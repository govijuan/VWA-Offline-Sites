Events in the Life of Sri Madhva
</div>
<div class="padding" id="content">
  <p align="left"><strong>Purnaprajna                : Anandatirtha : Madhva </strong></p>
  <p>Even from childhood, the                religious student Vasudeva (Madhva) had spiritual learning; he was drawn to                the path or renunciation.  Further,                he possessed an extraordinary intelligence.                 While the parents were eager to prepare him to set up a                family, Vasudeva went far away from home and family, thinking that                the entire universe was his home.                 Even as a young boy of eleven years, he chose initiation                into the monastic order from Acyuta-prajna, a reputed ascetic of                the time, near Udupi, in the year Saumya (1249 A.D.)6 The                preceptor Acyuta-prajna7 gave the boy Vasudeva the name                of ‘Purnaprajna’ at the time of his initiation into sanyaasa. </p>
  <p>Only within forty days of his                initiation into sanyaasa, a very remarkable episode occurred in                the Acharya’s career.  Expert                scholars in Tarka (logic) of nation wide fame, such as Vasudeva                Pandita, arrived in Udupi in the course of their search for a                competitor who might conquer them in debate.                 This proud scholar who had sounded his drum of victory                everywhere in the country was defeated by the little monk-Purnaprajna. </p>
  <p>Rejoicing at the extyraordinary                brilliance of the little monk, his preceptor Acyuta-prajna                consecrated Puurnaprajna as the head of the empire of Vedanta and                conferred on him the title ‘Anandatirtha’. </p>
  <p>Another time, a Buddhist                scholar visited the holy center of Acyuta-prajna.                 He was accompanied by another scholar, Vadisimha, who had                embraced Buddhism after his defeat by Buddhisagara in a                philosophical debate, though he was originally a follower of Vedic                religion. </p>
  <p>Puurnaprajna silenced both                these Buddhist scholars who had traveled all over the country                winning certificates of victory in philosophical debates.                 The joy of Acyuta-prajna was boundless.                 The title ‘Ananda-tirtha’ conferred by him on                Puurnaprajna at the time of the latter’s consecration function                became indeed meaningful. </p>
  <p>Thus Puurnaprajna is the                Acharya’s name given to him at the time of Samnyasa.                 The name conferred on him at the time of consecration as                the Master of Vedanta is ‘Ananda-tirtha’.                 And the favourite nom de plume assumed by him by choice is                the Vedic name ‘Madhva’8.  The Acharya gained publicity later on by this favourite name                itself, traceable to the Vedas. </p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>Southern                Tour</strong> </p>
  <p>The Acharya set out on a tour of South India even in his                teens.  He visited                prominent places of pilgrimage like Anantashayana, Kanyaakumaari,                Ramesvara ad Sriranga.  Wherever                he went, he delivered discourses and preached the message of his                Tattvavada or religious truth to the people.                 This initiated a new discussion among scholars all over                India.  The Acharya                refuted in clear terms a few age-old beliefs.                 He stated that spirituality should not be mixed up with                superstitions.  As a                result, there was hot opposition to him from some orthodox                extremists.  But the                Acharya braved it all with courage, without yielding to any mean                threats. </p>
  <p>The urge which was deeply                surging in the heart of the Acharya for long turned into a firm                resolve as a result of this tour.                 The superstitions in the way of this path of philosophical                truth should be wiped out!  My                whole life should be dedicated to the spread of ultimate truth’. </p>
  <p>The first task accomplished by                the Acharya as soon as he returned to Udupi, after adopting this                firm resolve, was the writing of a commentary (bhashya) on the                Bhagavadgita. </p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>The                Call of Badari </strong></p>
  <p><img src="../images/general/madhva.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="445" align="right">In                course of time, the Acharya desired to tour North India and to                spread the message of Vedic religion far and wide.                 The holy center of Badari beckoned to him irresistibly.                 Fired by the wish to visit holy places like Vyasa’s                hermitage, the penance-grove of Nara-Narayana etc., and to present                his commentary on the Gita as a tribute to sage Vyasa, the Acharya                moved straight to Badari.  There                he observed a vow of strict silence for 48 days, bathing in the                holy Ganga.  And then                he set out alone towards Vyasa-Badari, his cherished destination. </p>
  <p>After his return from there,                the task of writing a commentary on the Brahma-sutras came to be                undertaken by the Acharya.  The                Acharya never wrote any work of his by hand.                 It was his practice to dictate continuously to his                disciples who would take them down.                 His composition of works was as facile as his discourses.                 A disciple of the Acharya, Satya-tirtha by name, reduced to                writing in palm leaves, whatever was dictated by the Acharya. </p>
  <p>In the meantime, the                Acharya’s influence had spread far and wide though out the                country.  Scholars all                over India were stunned by his extra-ordinary genius, never seen                or heard of before.  The                circle of his disciples grew bigger and bigger.                 Some ascetics got initiation from him and were admitted                into the order of samnyasa. </p>
  <p>Once, while returning from                Badari, the Acharya was camping enroute in a holy place on the                banks of the Godavari.  Here                he was accosted by an eminent pandit, Sobhana-bhatta by name.                 This person was well known in that region as a peerless                scholar.  This visit                changed the entire career of the man.                 Seeing the extraordinary personality of the Acharya, and                listening to his wonderful discourses, he was so much overwhelmed                that he became the Acharya’s desciple and joined his retinue. </p>
  <p>Acyuta Prajna’s cup of                happiness was full on seeing Acharya Madhva back home after his                resounding victory in all parts of the country and on his rich                retinue of disciples hailing from different places.                 Though in the beginning he too had his own doubts about the                Acharya’s view of ultimate reality (Tattvavada), now he became a                whole-hearted adherent of the Acharya’s new philosophy. </p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>Installation                of Krishna - Return to Badari </strong></p>
  <p>                The                Acharya who stayed in the environs of Udupi for some more time                wrote his bhasyas or authoritative commentaries on all the ten                Uanishads.  He                composed glosses on forty hymns of the Rgveda, opening up for the                first time its vista of spiritual significance.                 He also wrote the treatise Bhagavata-tatparya highlighting                the essential teachings of the Puranas.                 Many topical handbooks were also authored by him to suit                different occasions.  A large number of of devotional songs too were composed by                him which could be sung by his disciples, while moving with him in                groups. </p>
  <p>It was during this period that                the Acharya installed the image of Krishna9 which he                found in the western ocean near the Udupi sea-coast.                 After sometime, he left some disciples behind for                performing Krishna’s worship and undertook his second tour to                Badari. </p>
  <p>Once the Acharya had to cross                the river Ganga.  The                other bank was under Muslim rule.                 Although stopped by the Muslim soldiers on the other side,                the Acharya boldly crossed the river and reached the other bank.                 He was taken before the Muslim ruler who was filled with                wonder by the boldness of the ascetic.10                 The Acharya said: ‘I worship that father who illumines                the entire universe; and so do you.                 Are we not both children of that only God?                 Why should I fear then either your soldiers or you?’ </p>
  <p>Hearing such words for the                first time from the mouth of a Hindu monk, the Muslim king was                astounded.  He was                filled with reverence for this unique monk.                 He begged the Acharya to stay permanently in his kingdom                and offered gifts of several jahagirs.                 But the Acharya who was free from worldly cravings,                rejected the offer and walked on to Badari, with the monk’s                staff in his hand. </p>
  <p>Once, when his party was                attacked by a band of robbers on the difficult road to the                Himalayas, athe Acharya made his pupil Upendra-tirtha silence them                after a fierce fight.  He                used to say: ‘One should cultivate strength of body even like                strength of mind; it is impossible for a weak body to house a                strong mind’.  Accordingly                he had made his disciples achieve strength in their body as well                as in their Vedantic pursuit. </p>
  <p>To the people of that time, the                Acharya’s physical strength itself was something miraculous,                because his body was strong and adamant.  Even to this day, the huge rock-boulder lifted up and placed                in the river Bhadra by the Acharya                 near Kalasa bears witness to his Herculean strength.  This incident is confirmed by the sentence inscribed on that                stone.11 </p>
  <p>The Acharya had darshana once                again of Lord Narayana and of sage Vyasa.                 On his return home thereafter, he wrote the treatise-Mahabharata-tatparya-nirnaya.                 On his way home, he visited Kashi.                 There he held a philosophical debate with an elderly                Advaita ascetic, Amarendra Puri.                 He had to go away silently, humbled by the dazzling genius                of the Acharya.  Then                came Kuruksetra.  Here                occurred a strange episode. </p>
  <p>                The Acharya got a mound there                excavated and demonstrated to his disciples the buried mace of                (the epic hero) Bhima therein; and once again had it buried under                the ground.</p>

He teached us that in the Vedic times the King and Queen behaved like good protective parents of all citizens and that even some of them, like in the case of Maharaj Sibi, they sacrificed their selves just to protect a bird. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Seeing the world through this prism it is actually shameful to speak about Children's Rights, because then we are recognizing that our society has come to a level of extreme insensibility and irresponsibility never imagined before. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The simple sight of one of them should melt the heart of any observer. But it seems that this is not more like this, because not only for the observer is a child an unknown, but also for his parents that in many cases would have prefer to kill the child before he was born. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The image of a child, a woman or an old person, are a natural call to give our affection and protection. But as the materialistic mentality grow in our society this three have become the principal victims of a world that day by day is turning more and more abuser and deaf. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome are all children that obliged us to develop virtues like affection, patient, tolerance, creativity, and responsibility. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The incarnation of God, Rsabhadev, said that is the duty of the parents to conduct their children through the path of liberation. In this way the child convert immediately his parents into Gurus. Is there any greater blessing of responsibility to our Creator? </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">In this way, every time one gets a child, God is telling us: “I put this soul under your protection. In the same way as I did to you, I am giving him this wonderful gift of the human body, teach him to take the most advantage out of it. Teach him to use it for the greatest welfare, that of spiritual service to humanity, of dedicating his entire life to come to Me…” </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">To receive a duty or great responsibility is a guaranty that in the future one will get the fruit of that great responsibility, which is why one should see it as a great blessing, because if life don't send any responsibility to you, means that she does not expect anything from you, and she does not want to give you any special thing. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">That's why when we become aware of the Children's rights, as we have discussed before, these reach even the transcendental nature of teaching them about God; we become more conscious of those responsibilities that take us far beyond an animal consciousness. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">We should dive deep in the meditation and study of these rights. Don't forget that we are all God's children. Don't forget that we must give love to every child; they are a blessing to the Earth. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Vaisnava das anudas </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Atulananda das </font></p>        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        <p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">Declaration of Children's Rights in Krishna Consciousness: </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Proclaimed by General Assembly of Vaisnavas (<a href="http://www.wva-vvrs.org/" target="_blank">WVA – The World Vaisnava Association – Visva Vaisnava Raj Sabha</a>) 20 November 2002 </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Whereas the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth, </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Whereas the need for such special safeguards has been stated in the Vedic literature, like the Srimad Bahagavatam, and recognized by our Guru Paramapara concerned with the welfare of children, </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Whereas mankind owes to the child the best it has to give, </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Now therefore, </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The General Assembly of Vaisnavas (<a href="http://www.wva-vvrs.org/" target="_blank">WVA – The World Vaisnava Association – Visva Vaisnava Raj Sabha</a>) </font></p>        <div align="left">          <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Proclaims this Declaration of the Rights of the Child to the end that he may have a happy childhood and enjoy for his own good and for the good of society the rights and freedoms herein set forth, and calls upon parents, upon men and women as individuals, and upon voluntary organizations, Spiritual Missions, Temples and their local authorities and well as National Governments to recognize these rights and strive for their observance measures progressively taken in accordance with the following principles: </font> </p>        </div>    </div></td>    <td width="122">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td height="773">&nbsp;</td>    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">1- The child, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding.

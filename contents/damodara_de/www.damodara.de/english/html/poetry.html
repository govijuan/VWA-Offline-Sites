Man! Thou art immortal soul!<br>        Thee Death can never melt.</p>      <p class="style10">For thee thy Sire on High has kept<br>        A store of bliss above,<br>        To end of time, thou art O!

Thy power and spell benign<br>        Now melt my soul to God;<br>        How can my earthly words describe<br>        That feeling soft and broad.</p>      <p class="style10">Enjoyment, sorrow -- what but lots<br>        To which the flesh is heir?<br>        The soul that sleeps alone concludes<br>        In them it hath a share.</p>      <p class="style10">And then, my friends, no more

   <p class="style10">Invocation</p>        <p class="style10">Sri Chaitanya and companions,<br>          descending to this dark abode,<br>          moved by merciful compassion,<br>          the path of self surrender showed.</p>        <p class="style10">Everlasting loving service<br>          unto the mighty Lord of all.<br>          Rarely reached, a boundless bliss,<br>          bestowed on every fallen soul.</p>        <p class="style10">A path that is the life and heart<br>          of those who truly seek that place,<br>          where none shall ever stand apart<br>          from God&rsquo;s great glory and his grace.</p>        <p class="style10">Humbleness and dedication,<br>          dependence on the Lord alone,<br>          confident of his protection,<br>          by these he quickly will be known.</p>        <p class="style10">Acting always agreeably<br>          toward the lord and his command.<br>          Avoiding sin unswervingly,<br>          shall swiftly take us to his land.</p>        <p class="style10">The ever youthful Nanda&rsquo;s son,<br>          Sri Krishna, peerless potentate,<br>          will always hear the prayers of one.<br>          who does this way appreciate.</p>        <p class="style10">With straw in teeth the poet falls<br>          before the Thakur and his Lord.<br>          Pray place me on this path he calls,<br>          So I might be to truth restored.</p>        <p class="style10">Dainya</p>        <p class="style10">I</p>        <p class="style10">O Lord, please hear this plea now placed,<br>          from one poor soul so long disgraced,<br>          who long ago forsook your feet,<br>          to meet distress and dire defeat.</p>        <p class="style10">While still within the womb tight bound,<br>          ever pressed by pain profound,<br>          I had of you a fleeting sight,<br>          And then you left me to my plight.</p>        <p class="style10">I swore at once to worship you,<br>          throughout my life I would be true.<br>          But birth soon brought bewilderment<br>          and into darkness swift descent.</p>        <p class="style10">Surrounded by adoring kin,<br>          my memories of grief grew dim.<br>          Within my parents&rsquo; fond embrace<br>          this world appeared the perfect place.</p>        <p class="style10">In lark and laughter life sped by,<br>          no thought that I would one day die.<br>          With all my mind and intellect<br>          I studied to secure respect.</p>        <p class="style10">Proud then of my paltry knowledge<br>          I sought but worldly privilege.<br>          Absorbed in family affairs<br>          my heart was lost in carnal cares.</p>        <p class="style10">O Lord, I called you not to mind,<br>          No time for worship could I find.<br>          A wasted life, now old and weak,<br>          too late your shelter do I seek.</p>        <p class="style10">II</p>        <p class="style10">Eagerly embracing learning,<br>          I filled my mind with mundane lore;<br>          lacking yet the deeper yearning,<br>          to know what life is really for.</p>        <p class="style10">Ever growing education<br>          appeared to be life&rsquo;s very aim.<br>          With it grew my expectation<br>          for worldly happiness and fame.</p>        <p class="style10">How futile was this foolish hope,<br>          For this knowledge gave only grief.<br>          Becoming but a binding rope<br>          to atheistic blind belief.</p>        <p class="style10">Erudition without wisdom,<br>          to know it should serve you alone,<br>          takes us further from your kingdom<br>          and turns the aching heart to stone.</p>        <p class="style10">Bound in bodily conception,<br>          the shining soul becomes an ass.<br>          Bearing on his back the burden<br>          of his material morass.</p>        <p class="style10">As one such ass I stand here now,<br>          to seek the shelter of your feet.<br>          I shall illusion disavow<br>          and cast aside my crass conceit.</p>        <p class="style10">Attacked by age, in agony,<br>          my paltry pleasures fail to please.<br>          As wordly wisdom comes to be<br>          a deleterious disease.</p>        <p class="style10">You lord are the one true treasure<br>          for which all sane men should aspire.<br>          Now all my learning I abjure,<br>          to have you as my one desire.</p>        <p class="style10">III</p>        <p class="style10">In my youth my one ambition<br>          was making money, more and more.<br>          Mindless of my life&rsquo;s real mission<br>          I wed and worked for wealth to store.</p>        <p class="style10">With my wife I made a household,<br>          wherein to waste my life away.<br>          As many children joined our fold<br>          I slowly sank in deep dismay.</p>        <p class="style10">My hopes for happiness all gone,<br>          crushed and worn by worry and stress,<br>          feeling myself fully undone,<br>          I found no freedom from duress.</p>        <p class="style10">Advancing age attacking me,<br>          disturbed in mind incessantly,<br>          beleaguered by debility,<br>          success is but a fantasy.</p>        <p class="style10">Still my desires do not depart,<br>          despite my incapacity.<br>          Countless hankerings haunt my heart,<br>          plaguing me with fevered worry.</p>        <p class="style10">Now all is darkness and despair.<br>          No path from my predicament.<br>          Fearful and filled with every care,<br>          I offer here my sad lament.</p>        <p class="style10">A tide of troubles sweeps me on,<br>          toward a dim and dreadful death.<br>          My vow that with my duty done,<br>          I&rsquo;d worship you now seems but breath.</p>        <p class="style10">Please hear me Lord, as one bereft,<br>          beseeching your benevolence.<br>          Now all is lost and all that&rsquo;s left<br>          Is prayers for your kind providence</p>        <p class="style10">IV</p>        <p class="style10">Absorbed in sin and wickedness,<br>          I&rsquo;m pleased to see another&rsquo;s pain.<br>          Without concern I cause distress<br>          to ever seek my selfish gain.</p>        <p class="style10">Devoid of conscience and of care.<br>          Deceit and cheating are my creed.<br>          Vain and vicious in all affairs.<br>          I staunchly serve both lust and greed.</p>        <p class="style10">Assiduous in sloth and sleep,<br>          resisting always righteousness.<br>          N vows or principles I keep,<br>          pursuing pleasure to excess.</p>        <p class="style10">While never knowing right from wrong<br>          I proudly preach but to impress,<br>          countless desires my heart do throng,<br>          and every ethic I transgress .</p>        <p class="style10">What godly man would ever be<br>          beheld in my vile company?<br>          Deprived of any piety,<br>          I merge myself in misery.</p>        <p class="style10">Diseased and in decrepitude.<br>          Ruined and wretched, crushed at heart.<br>          The Thakur prays in humble mood<br>          and does his tragedy impart.</p>        <p class="style10">V</p>        <p class="style10">Lord hear this tale of grief I tell.<br>          I drank from out the poisoned well<br>          of worldliness and ignorance,<br>          as if it were sweet sustenance.</p>        <p class="style10">Now lacking all enlightenment<br>          and transcendental sentiment,<br>          my fruitless life is fading fast<br>          and I am dismally downcast.</p>        <p class="style10">Thus fallen into sin and shame.<br>          The lowest wretch; and yet you came<br>          to save such wicked souls as me.<br>          I call now on your clemency.</p>        <p class="style10">Forever Lord you are our friend.<br>          All our adversity shall end<br>          when every breath becomes a prayer<br>          and we are tightly in your care.</p>        <p class="style10">If now you judged me you would find.<br>          qualities of the vilest kind.<br>          Forbear dear Lord, pray lift me up,<br>          To deeply drink your loving cup.</p>        <p class="style10">VI</p>        <p class="style10">Lord I seek your sanctuary<br>          that I abandoned long ago.<br>          The everlasting ecstasy<br>          that mundane mind can never know.</p>        <p class="style10">As dry now as a desert plain,<br>          my mind is scorched by worldliness.<br>          Lamenting always for my pain,<br>          I&rsquo;m falling into feebleness.</p>        <p class="style10">Master of the meek and humble,<br>          I turn to you in helplessness.<br>          All my hopes around me crumble,<br>          But that Lord for your tenderness.</p>        <p class="style10">Pray give to me the company<br>          of those devoted to your feet,<br>          for with them shall I ever be<br>          immersed within a joy complete.</p>        <p class="style10">Discussions of your divine deeds<br>          with those whose love for you is sure,<br>          uproots at once the sinful weeds<br>          from out the heart to leave it pure</p>        <p class="style10">A single yearning seizes me,<br>          that constantly I call your name,<br>          in your abode of sanctity,<br>          your love forever to proclaim.</p>        <p class="style10">VII</p>        <p class="style10">Assigned here by amoral mind,<br>          relief nor rescue could I find,<br>          pursuing only pain and sin,<br>          till your pure servant entered in.</p>        <p class="style10">Dear Lord he found me fallen low,<br>          and feeling pity had me know,<br>          how one so great had taken birth<br>          to benedict the blessed earth.</p>        <p class="style10">Humbled soul please heed this message,<br>          So said to me that saintly sage.<br>          For by it shall your heart be cheered;<br>          the Lord has with his dhama appeared.</p>        <p class="style10">In Navadwip, that holy land,<br>          Chaitanya reaches out his hand,<br>          to lift us from calamity<br>          and lead us to eternity.</p>        <p class="style10">As vowed in Vedic verse of old,<br>          a brahmin&rsquo;s son, of colour gold,<br>          Mahaprabhu, he shall be called,<br>          with brother Nitai, all foretold.</p>        <p class="style10">Engulfing all in ecstasy,<br>          Krishna himself has come to free<br>          the souls who suffer in their shame,<br>          by giving them his holy name.</p>        <p class="style10">Go then and receive salvation,<br>          was your servant&rsquo;s exhortation.<br>          Thus falling at your feet prostrate,<br>          In tears do I my tale relate.</p>        <p class="style10">Atmanivedanam (Dedication of the Self)</p>        <p class="style10">I</p>        <p class="style10">No practises of piety,<br>          nor knowledge of the self I sought.<br>          Absorbed in sensuality,<br>          my useless life has come to nought.</p>        <p class="style10">Never given to glorify<br>          your goodness Lord, I thus did cheat<br>          myself, and failed to purify<br>          my heart from Maya&rsquo;s blind conceit.</p>        <p class="style10">Yet you Lord are the fountainhead<br>          of mercy and majestic grace.<br>          Thus all my pointless pride I shed,<br>          for at your feet I find my place.</p>        <p class="style10">You promise always to protect<br>          all those whose only goal is you.<br>          If you this sinful wretch reject,<br>          no hope is left for my rescue.</p>        <p class="style10">Driven always by dark desire,<br>          I long for freedom and for peace,<br>          when lust and longings all expire,<br>          and ignorant illusions cease.</p>        <p class="style10">Thus the Thakur&rsquo;s contemplation<br>          culminates in one conclusion.<br>          Serving you without cessation<br>          is the final absolution.</p>        <p class="style10">II</p>        <p class="style10">In pain Lord now my tale I tell,<br>          of how I turned from you and fell.<br>          Without the slightest shame or sense,<br>          and careless of all consequence.</p>        <p class="style10">While in this world my time has been<br>          comprised of sin and only sin.<br>          Thus wracked by torment and by toil<br>          I did my wretched life despoil.</p>        <p class="style10">Though prodigal and profligate,<br>          I seek now freedom from my fate.<br>          But surely Lord you will decree<br>          that I be punished properly.</p>        <p class="style10">Thus taking birth repeatedly<br>          within this world of misery,<br>          I can but pray Lord that my mind<br>          Will ever be to you inclined.</p>        <p class="style10">I beg that by your servants&rsquo; side<br>          I shall remain, devoid of pride.<br>          With humbled heart my hope is now<br>          You will on me your grace endow.</p>        <p class="style10">III</p>        <p class="style10">Now body, mind and family,<br>          and everything I think I own,<br>          dear Lord of limitless beauty.<br>          I offer unto you alone.</p>        <p class="style10">In good or bad or life or death,<br>          though plagued by all perplexity<br>          With your name ever on my breath<br>          I rise above anxiety.</p>        <p class="style10">Whatever you may choose to do,<br>          protecting me or punishing,<br>          I shall not swerve from serving you,<br>          for you shall ever be my king.</p>        <p class="style10">If I am born at your behest<br>          once more within this world of woe,<br>          I fall down with but one request,<br>          that to your servant&rsquo;s house I go.</p>        <p class="style10">Let me be a worm or lower,<br>          if as your slave I shall remain.<br>          I wish not for the greatest power<br>          if from your service I refrain.</p>        <p class="style10">I yearn but for the company<br>          of one who is forever free,<br>          of all that is illusory<br>          and loves but you incessantly.</p>        <p class="style10">Father, lover, son and mother,<br>          you are everything to me.<br>          Master, spouse and any other<br>          you alone Lord shall all these be.</p>        <p class="style10">Thus does Bhaktivinod pray,<br>          Lord of Radha, I here implore,<br>          That in my heart you always stay,<br>          my life and soul for evermore</p>        <p class="style10">IV</p>        <p class="style10">From today I shall abandon<br>          all thoughts of I and mine.<br>          All I saw as my possession,<br>          I do to you assign.</p>        <p class="style10">I am Lord yours and yours alone;<br>          your glory to proclaim.<br>          All sense of separation gone.<br>          United with your aim.</p>        <p class="style10">My body, home and family,<br>          Belong Lord but to you<br>          I ever shall your servant be<br>          Your will I will but do.</p>        <p class="style10">This house and everything I have<br>          Are yours Lord from now on<br>          I live here as your humble slave<br>          For pleasing you alone</p>        <p class="style10">Now all past sins and piety<br>          from body or from mind<br>          Are burned in their entirety<br>          As I redemption find</p>        <p class="style10">Two wills united now as one<br>          My sense of self is lost<br>          I only do what must be done<br>          To please you at all cost.</p>        <p class="style10">V</p>        <p class="style10">A single service now remains,<br>          to wait with love on you,<br>          and happily I take all pains,<br>          your pleasure to pursue.</p>        <p class="style10">I feel now but one bond within<br>          my heart for you alone,<br>          and all my worldly kith and kin<br>          I all at once disown.</p>        <p class="style10">Abandoning all attachment<br>          to all I saw as mine,<br>          I understand that all is meant<br>          For duties all divine.</p>        <p class="style10">Quite unaware of good or bad,<br>          in terms of my desire.<br>          That somehow I shall make you glad<br>          is all that I aspire.</p>        <p class="style10">I&rsquo;m but the watchman at your door<br>          who guards your hearth and home.<br>          Everything I earn is for<br>          your happiness alone</p>        <p class="style10">My mind and senses you command,<br>          to do with as you pleasel.<br>          Their wilfulness I will withstand<br>          with ever growing ease.</p>        <p class="style10">Never seeking selfish pleasure,<br>          your joy is all I crave.<br>          The only hope I now treasure<br>          To be your sold out slave.</p>        <p class="style10">VI</p>        <p class="style10">In truth dear Lord all things are yours.<br>          The soul can nothing claim.<br>          All other thought will surely cause<br>          suffering and shame.</p>        <p class="style10">Identifying with the flesh,<br>          in complete confusion,<br>          we are entirely enmeshed<br>          with illusory possession.</p>        <p class="style10">Captivated by this conceit,<br>          I&lsquo;m bound by mortal coil.<br>          Fallen from your lotus feet<br>          into this world of toil.</p>        <p class="style10">Now drowning in a sea of grief,<br>          I flounder helplessly.<br>          No hope remains to find relief,<br>          till you Lord set me free.</p>        <p class="style10">And so in agony I turn<br>          toward you once again.<br>          Lord let me this one lesson learn,<br>          that leaving you means pain.</p>        <p class="style10">Let all thought of autonomy<br>          a Abandon me this day;<br>          for fooled by this great falsity,<br>          my true self I betray</p>        <p class="style10">Thus falling at Lord Nitai&rsquo;s feet,<br>          the Thakur begs and prays<br>          for all false pride to soon retreat<br>          through his unbounded grace.</p>        <p class="style10">VII</p>        <p class="style10">My fallen and most wretched state<br>          is plain for all to see.<br>          No load of sins has been so great,<br>          as which is borne by me</p>        <p class="style10">No soul in all the universe,<br>          Could so offensive be.<br>          My dire disgrace grows only worse,<br>          as I strive to be free.</p>        <p class="style10">But surely Lord you understand<br>          the full scope of my shame.<br>          Thus helplessly I take your hand;<br>          your glory to proclaim</p>        <p class="style10">For you receive the fallen soul<br>          and free him from his pain<br>          Awarding him life&rsquo;s highest goal;<br>          your company again</p>        <p class="style10">This world and all within is yours.<br>          In you offenses die.<br>          For those who have no other cause,<br>          but you to satisfy</p>        <p class="style10">All that ever was or will be,<br>          is, my Lord, you alone.<br>          We search for shelter uselessly,<br>          till you in truth are known.</p>        <p class="style10">Offenders at your feet like me,<br>          will in the end be free.<br>          When finally we seek to be,<br>          Yours perpetually.</p>    </div></td>

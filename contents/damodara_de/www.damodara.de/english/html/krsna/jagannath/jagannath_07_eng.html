But Brahma said: Sri Kshetra is a place manifested by the eternal potency of the Lord, where he manifests himself. So therefore it is not in my ability to install the Lord here. Lord Jagannatha and his abode are eternally situated in this material world, by His mercy, so just put a flag on top of the temple, and I will give the blessing that the person who sees this flag from far away, and gives his references to the flag, he will be liberated.</font></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <div align="center">         <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><a href="gallery/jay_20_jpg_eng.html"><img src="../../../../espaniol/images/galeria/blancoynegro/jagannatha/pagina/jay_20pg.jpg" width="252" height="329" border="0"></a></p>        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Lord Brahma placing the flag on the temple.</font></p>      </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td height="110">       <div align="center">         <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After sometime,  king Indrayumna felt very sad by not being able no see Nila Madhava.

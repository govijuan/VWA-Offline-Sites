Every night the sabara left, and the next day about midday, he returned, smelling like camphor, musk and sandalwood. Vidyapati asked his wife what was going on. She told him that her father was going to a secret place to adore the deity of Nila Madhava.</font></p>        </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td height="413">       <div align="center">         <p><a href="gallery/jay_05_jpg_eng.html"><img src="../../../../espaniol/images/galeria/blancoynegro/jagannatha/pagina/jay_05pg.jpg" width="301" height="319" border="0"></a></p>        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Vidyavati asking his wife about her father.</font></p>    </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>      <div align="center">        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After hearing this the happiness of Vidyavati knew no bounds.

Vidyapati was very anxious to see the deity of Nila Madhava, and therefore Lalita asked her father if he could take him to take darsan of his worshipable deity.Finally, after insisting for a long time, the sabara Visvasu fulfilled the desire of his daughter, but with the condition that he could not see the road. So he covered the eyes of Vidyapati and took him to the deity Nila Madhava.        </font>         </font></p>        </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td height="406">       <div align="center">         <p><a href="gallery/jay_06_jpg_eng.html"><img src="../../../../espaniol/images/galeria/blancoynegro/jagannatha/pagina/jay_06pg.jpg" width="248" height="340" border="0"></a></p>        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Visvasu takes Vidyapati to see the Deity.</font></p>      </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td height="244">       <div align="center">         <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the meantime while they where preparing to leave, Lalita secretly put some mustard seeds in the bag of her husband's clothe, so that he could mark the way.

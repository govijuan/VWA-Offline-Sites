O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of Ramachandra. All glories to you. In the battle of Lanka You destroy the ten-headed demon Ravana and distribute his heads as a delightful offering to the presiding deities of the ten directions, headed by Indra. This action was long desired by all of them, who were much harassed by this monster.<br>      </p>      <p>(8)<br>        vahasi vapushi vishade vasanam jaladabham<br>        hala-hati-bhiti-milita-yamunabham<br>        keshava dhrita-haladhara-rupa jaya jagadisha hare</p>      <p>O Keshava!

In the form of Matsya You rescue the Vedas, and as Kurma You bear the Mandara Mountain on Your back. As Varaha You lift the earth with your tusk, and in the form of Narasimha you tear open the chest of the daitya Hiranyakashipu. In the form of Vamana You trick the daitya king Bali by asking him for only three steps of land, and then You take away the whole universe from him by expanding your steps. As Parashurama you slay all of the wicked kshatriyas, and as Ramachandra You conquer the rakshasa king Ravana. In the form of Balarama You carry a plow with which You subdue the wicked and draw toward you the River Yamuna. As Lord Buddha You show compassion toward all the living beings suffering in this world, and at the end of the Kali-yuga You appear as Kalki to bewilder the mlecchas [degraded low-class men].</p>

Thus they enjoy the present-- which seldom happens to us.&quot; -Jean de La Bruyäre </p>    <p class="style3">-“Children need models more than they need critics.” -Joseph Joubert </p>    <p class="style3">-“Children require guidance and sympathy far more than instruction.” -Ambrose Gwinett Bierce- </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;Children have to be educated, but they have also to be left to educate themselves.&quot; - &nbsp; Ernest Dimnet </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;Children whose curiosity survives parental discipline and who manage to grow up before they blow up are invited to join the Yale faculty. Within the university they go on asking their questions and trying to find the answers ... it is a place where the world's hostility to curiosity can be defied.&quot; - Edmund S. Morgan </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;I am afraid we must make the world honest before we can honestly say to our children that honesty is the best policy.&quot; - &nbsp; Sir Walter Besant </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;How is it that little children are so intelligent and men so stupid? It must be education that does it.&quot; -  Alexandre Dumas </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;For that's what a woman, a mother wants -- to teach her children to take an interest in life. She knows it's safer for them to be interested in other people's happiness than to believe in their own.&quot; - &nbsp;  Athennus </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;If we are to teach real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we shall have to begin with the children.&quot; - &nbsp; Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;I have a dream that my 4 children will one day live in a nation Where they will not be judged by the color of their skin But by the content of their character.&quot; - &nbsp; Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;I must say the biggest lesson you can learn in life, or teach your children, is that life is not castles in the skies, happily ever after. The biggest lesson we have to give our children is truth.&quot; - &nbsp; Goldie Ha </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;In the little world in which children have their existence, whosoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt, as injustice.&quot; - &nbsp; Charles Dickens </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;In the life of children there are two very clear-cut phases, before and after puberty. Before puberty the child's personality has not yet formed and it is easier to guide its life and make it acquire specific habits of order, discipline, and work: after puberty the personality develops impetuously and all extraneous intervention becomes odious, tyrannical, insufferable. Now it so happens that parents feel the responsibility towards their children precisely during this second period, when it is too late: then of course the stick and violence enter the scene and yield very few results indeed. Why not instead take an interest in the child during the first period?&quot; - &nbsp; Antonio Gramsci </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.&quot; - &nbsp; Maya Angelou </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;Love your children with all your hearts, love them enough to discipline them before it is too late. ... Praise them for important things, even if you have to stretch them a bit. Praise them a lot. They live on it like bread and butter and they need it more than bread and butter.&quot; -  Lavina Christensen Fugal </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;Live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity, They think of you.&quot; - &nbsp;  H. Jackson Brown, Jr. </p>    <p class="style3">&nbsp; &quot;Keep me away from the wisdom that does not cry, the philosophy which does not laugh and the greatness which does not bow before children.&quot; - &nbsp;Kahlil Gibran </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;Just think of the tragedy of teaching children not to doubt.&quot; - &nbsp;  Paul Anderson </p>    <p class="style3">&quot;It is good to realize that if love and peace can prevail on earth, and if we can teach our children to honor nature's gifts, the joys and beauties of the outdoors will be here forever.&quot; - James Earl &quot;Jimmy&quot; Carter, Jr. </p>    </td>    <td width="49">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td height="57">&nbsp;</td>    <td valign="top"><div align="center">      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p class="style2"><a href="childrights.html">Back to Children's Rights</a> </p>      <p class="style2"><a href="../index_eng_01.html">Back to Main Menu </a></p>    </div></td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body>

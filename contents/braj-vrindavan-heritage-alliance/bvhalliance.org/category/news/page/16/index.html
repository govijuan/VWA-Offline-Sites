			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/the-bridge-to-nowhere-came-from-nowhere/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>Yesterday Sevak Sharanji and Paramadvaiti Maharaj took a delegation from  the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Foundation to the Mathura Vrindavan  Development Authority (MVDA) with the object of finding (1) the master  plan for Vrindavan development and (2) the plans for the “half moon  bridge.”</p>
<p>The first surprise was that there is no master plan. The  Braj Foundation’s master plan, mentioned earlier here in this group&#8217;s  discussions, is apparently about tourism only and does not address  infrastructure issues.</p>
<p>Vineet Narain, the person behind The Braj  Foundation, who is working closely with Ramesh Baba in Barsana, has  been accused by some people of approving or recommending the bridge.  This is categorically untrue.</p>
<p>The second surprise was that the  MVDA had nothing to do with the bridge and that it is entirely under the  Public Works Department.</p>
<p>After getting the necessary maps and  documents available at the MVDA, the BVHA delegation moved on to the  PWD, where they were first surprised to encounter a crowd of anxious  people from Vrindavan. The BVHA representatives learned that the PWD has  sent bulldozers to the Parikrama Marg near Madan Mohan and started  bulldozing the illegal constructions there, as per the Allahabad High  Court decision.</p>
<p>I don’t know that there was any requirement for  immediate leveling of these buildings, and without a subsequent plan it  seems a little drastic, but at least it is interesting to see that there  is some rapid reaction and action.</p>
<p>The PWD gave all the maps  requested by the BVHA, though they were a little suspicious at first.  However, the big surprise was that the bridge plans were… non-existent  for all intents and purposes. The plan provided by Jai Prakash  Associates Limited, the contractor for the bridge, was nothing more than  an inked-in line over a map of the Yamuna at Keshi Ghat.</p>
<p>Before turning it over, however, the clerk at the PWD whited out the official signatures that gave approval to the project.</p>
<p>The long and short of all this is that the bridge was approved</p>
<p>(1) Without any engineering plans or blueprints<br />
(2) Without environmental impact assessments<br />
(3) Without any municipal hearings, etc.</p>
<p>If  the PWD and MVDA did indeed release all the relevant documents to the  BVHA delegation, then what we suspected has been confirmed: the project  was rammed through without any planning or discussion whatsoever.</p>
<p>Government  money was made available and everyone was rushing to think of ways to  get that money into circulation as fast as possible without any other  consideration.</p>
<p>The plans do, however, show that the intention is  there to build a 9.5 meter road, i.e., a four-lane boulevard, on the  Parikrama Marg, with a two-meter sand track for pilgrims on foot.  Whether that is the best option is worth discussion. I personally would  not be in favor of it, as it would split the ghats off from the scenic  side of the Yamuna floodplane and in other ways disrupt the organic  connection of the Yamuna to the town.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s push for the Parikrama Marg to be a Green Belt : harit patti.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  the news is very good for our side. It will be very hard for the  government and JP Associates to make the case that they thought this  project out thoroughly or consulted with the community, etc. This will  make their task on Feb. 23, at the second hearing, very difficult.</p>
<p>What that does, though, is set the scene for the UNESCO meetings, which have now been rescheduled for April 23.</p>

31/1/2010 Meeting, 3 PM<br />
Vrindavan Research Institute<br />
Meeting Minutes</p>
<p>Attendees:<br />
Chandan Goswami<br />
B.A. Paramadvaiti<br />
Sadhu Maharaj<br />
Hari Mohan Malvia<br />
Sevak Sharan<br />
Katie Jo Walter<br />
Jagannath Poddar<br />
Vrindaban Behari<br />
Nirguna devi dasi<br />
Madhumangal Shukla<br />
Manjari Ehrlichman<br />
Prashant Singh<br />
Rajendra Verma<br />
Jagadananda das<br />
Rahul Gopal<br />
Madhuvdan das</p>
<p>Madhumangal  Shukla shared an ad posted in the local papers announcing that the MVDA  is abiding by the court order. The ad warned that all illegal  construction on the Yamuna must stop and that violators would be  punished.</p>
<p>Chandan Goswami and Madhumangal Shukla will go to  Kumbha Mela to garner support for efforts against the bridge atKeshi  Ghat from sadhus and locals. They will use a poster created by VRINDA  using images from Chandan Goswami’s presentation shared in the last BVH  meeting.</p>
<p>Madhumangal Shukla and Jagannath Poddar gave an update  on the stay order regarding the bridge; Construction in metal works is  still in progress. It is suggested that pictures be taken and sent to  MVDA Commissioner.</p>
<p>Nirguna devi dasi spoke about the need to  include the general public and make them aware of the bridge issue. She  noted that theatre is a very effective tool for communicating with the  public here. She also suggested that BVHA start issuing press releases,  as this practice has been highly effective in promoting the work of Food  for Life Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Jagadananda das suggested that the BVHA  (either officially or not) take out a monthly ad informing the public  about heritage and environment issues and development alternatives. Many  group members said that this would be an expensive undertaking, so the  suggestion was made to publish a 4-page monthly newsletter on our own.</p>
<p>The  need to get information about the bridge case and the BVHA’s concerns  out to NGO’s working in relevant areas was reemphasized. This need was  mentioned at the previous meeting on January 26, but action has yet to  be taken in this area.<br />
Sevak Sharan mentioned a threefold plan of immediate action:</p>
<p>I. Promote local awareness<br />
II. Create a master plan for pilgrimage centers<br />
III. Identify  on a political level</p>
<p>Discussion  took place that BVHA should make it their priority to fight any  immediate threats in Braj. This raised the issue of the necessity of  gaining the support of Ramesh Baba and Vineet Narain, two powerful  figures who have been very effective in addressing issues in the hills  of Braj in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Chandan Goswami said that there are two immediate issues:</p>
<p>I. Fund raising needs to be pursued to cover court costs<br />
II.  Members need to set weekly petition signature gathering goals  (2,000-3,000 each week was given as an example) and present their  progress to the BVHA at meetings.</p>
<p>Chandan Goswami told the group  that he and other members who were present at the first BVHA meeting had  printable petitions and that these would be copied and shared with the  group.  It was agreed that signature collection in the greater Braj area  was also necessary.</p>
<p>B.A. Pramadvaiti suggested that BVHA members  personally visit Pushpa Sharma to let her now the BVHA’s argument and  to invite her to participate in BVHA meetings. Paramadvaiti-ji  emphasized the importance of trying to include and/or influence local  governing individuals and departments before working against them at  higher levels.</p>
<p>He also brought up the fact that Sri Madhu Pandit  Dasa of ISKCON Bangalore offered to buy and design Keshi Ghat area, but  he was turned down because politicians would lose out on contracting  money.</p>
<p>Rajendra Verma stressed the importance of reaching out to  the greater public and bringing as many people and organizations on  board as possible. This sparked a discussion on the possibility of  holding two meetings each week:  one involving a core group of people  who would operate as a steering committee and one including anyone and  everyone who wants to show up and discuss ideas presented by the  steering committee.</p>
<p>Chandan Goswami asked for an update regarding  UNESCO director’s next visit to Vrindavan in February. It was  acknowledged that not much has been done in preparation for this. (Note:  Secretary has since learned that the visit in fact will not take place  until early April). Jagadananda das offered to follow up with Shrivatsa  Goswami regarding the upcoming meeting with UNESCO.</p>
<p>After an  acknowledgement that BVHA needs someone to follow up with members to  make sure they are doing promised work, a position of BVHA Guide was  created. This is a position that will rotate amongst various group  members. Sevak Sharan was voted in as the group’s first Guide.</p>
<p>B.A.  Paramadvaiti mentions the support of Rhagubabu, an employee of the  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für  Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).  He adds that GTZ has recently offered  to create a Master Plan for Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti-ji also suggests that BVHA member assess their skill areas and work accordingly.</p>
<p>It  is mentioned that someone needs to talk to the School of Planning and  Architecture in Delhi and specifically to Professor Nalini Thakur. Katie  Jo Walter had pre-existing plans to meet Professor Thakur in the coming  week and agreed to talk to her about the creation of a Vrindavan Master  Plan.</p>
<p>Katie Jo Walter notified the alliance of her plans to  visit organizations in Delhi that have either played a role in trying to  conserve Braj in the past or have the potential to do so in the future.  These meetings had been arranged for the purpose of Katie’s research.  She offered to make organizations aware of BVHA efforts and appeal to  them for support. Chandan Goswami gave her permission to approach these  organizations as a member of the alliance.</p>
<p>Manjari Ehrlichman  proposed that BVHA create a list of all of Vrindavan’s religious leaders  so the group can contact them and present them with information.  Chandan Goswami said that such a list exists and he has it.</p>
<p>B.A. Paramadvaiti asks that a Meeting Coordinator position be created and filled at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The next BVHA meeting will take place at Kumbha Mela on Sunday, February 7th, from 2-4 PM.</p>

<p>I wrote you at the end of last year,  in the throes of frustration as I felt my death approaching. Now that  the Commonwealth Games are at the door, I write you once again from my  death bed, asking you for justice.</p>
<p>I am the mother of one sixth  of humanity, but have now become a stigma on my own sons, who are raping  me for their own prosperity and development. I want to tell you my  story and what I am thinking as I lie here on my deathbed.</p>
<p>My  story starts in a myth and in a reality. My sons believe that I came  from heaven, while scientists say that I originate in the glaciers of  Himalayas. I believe both are right. My father is the Himalaya and I  have my source in the Yamunotari glacier, now in the state of  Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>My birth was considered to be the result of the  vows taken by the Aryan civilization. This ancient civilization started  flourishing on my banks, and my sister Ganga also supported this cause.</p>
<p>The  world’s greatest religion was founded on my banks. Avatars like Sri  Krishna played in my lap. Hazrat Nizamuddin, the follower of the last  Prophet, spread the message of peace in front of my eyes. Sahib-e-Kamal  Guru Gobind Singh composed divine poems in my company.</p>
<p>Mighty  rulers came to conquer these lands of mine. My children fought well;  many were martyred, but they never surrendered. I am the symbol of their  courage and spirit of freedom.</p>
<p>When the British moved the royal  center of India from my banks, I felt a little bit discouraged. Blood  was shed, but finally peace came and eventually they returned to my  daughter Delhi the same status she had before. I felt satisfied.</p>
<p>And  then, on the mighty night of 14th August, 1947 my children claimed  independence. The first Prime Minister of India removed the flag of  slavery from the Red Fort and displayed the flag of sovereignty. My eyes  were full of tears and my heart was filled with happiness. I felt so  proud of my sons.</p>
<p><img title="Indo-Gangetic plain" src="http://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/Indo-Gangetic_Plain.jpg" alt="Indo-Gangetic plain" width="380" height="285" /></p>
<p><span><em>Satellite image of the Indo-gangetic plain, showing haze and pollution over Bangladesh and North-Eastern India</em></span></p>
<p>Source: <a title="NASA observatory" href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=10579&amp;oldid=5419" target="_blank">NASA</a><br />
But  my hopes started shattering with the rise of India. I saw the  development begin. My soul started to question the inhuman face of  ongoing progress. My own sons started encroaching my hands. Somewhere  they constructed huge dams to suck my blood. I said nothing; instead, I  felt proud with the thought that I was able to serve my children.</p>
<p>At  the gateway to my daughter Delhi, at Wazirabad, I was again taken  captive. The water from my body was taken to satisfy the unquenchable  thirst of the capital. My heart was delighted with this.</p>
<p>But at  the same time I was welcomed at the entrance to the city by the  Najafgarh drain. I bowed my head and accepted the indignity. I made the  cancerous water part of my pure blood. But this was not the end of the  cruel treatment: in town after town,  other drains forced me to accept  their poisonous streams. Agra, Vrindavan, Mathura and Allahabad did not  protest Delhi&#8217;s sins, but started competing with her in their  destruction of my purity. I felt betrayed.</p>
<p>Today, after only 60  years of independence, I am dying. Though I am practically unconscious  lying here on my death bed, sometimes my lips start moving.</p>
<p>I  have to laugh at my foolish children. On the one hand, they are raping  me and my sisters, their own mothers, the givers of their life, while on  the other, they are engaged in useless fighting for the Rama temple in  Ayodhya. For this, they burned the whole of Gujarat and Mumbai.</p>
<p>This  seems very contradictory to me. I am their mother, who exists in this  world just to serve them, but instead of fighting to save me, they kill  thousands of innocent people for someone who may be nothing more than a  legend.</p>
<p>And now they have taken up the cause of Amarnath. My sons  are the most foolish people I have seen in the world. For a mere plot  of land, they set heaven abd earth on fire. They watch me and my  sisters, their mothers by whose pure milk they have grown and  flourished, dwindle and die, while they fight away for a God they cannot  see.</p>
<p>Shame on me. Shame on my children.</p>
<p>Mother of 115 crores of shameless people.</p>
<p>Yamuna Devi</p>

<span>Allahabad</span>:  The Allahabad high court on Saturday stopped construction of a bridge  alongside river Yamuna at Vrindavan as it was found to be in violation  of the Indian Archaeological Act and the environment (protection) Act.</p>
<p>The  court also banned all illegal construction on the land between the  ghats and the river and dumping of garbage in the area in the  Vrindavan-Mathura stretch.</p>
<p>The order to the effect was passed by a  division Bench of Justice VM Sahai and Justice VK Dixit. As the entire  area comes under the Taj Trapezium Zone, prima facie, the Bench said,  the construction work alongside the river without Supreme Court&#8217;s  permission was a serious matter.</p>
<p>Hearing a public interest  litigation (PIL) moved by Madhu Mangal Shukla, the Bench not only stayed  construction of the bridge and other illegal constructions, but also  banned dumping of garbage in the Yamuna and on its banks.</p>
<p>The  court directed the departments concerned, including the Pollution  Control Board and the Central environment department, to ensure that no  further construction was done in the Vrindavan area.</p>
<p>The court also asked the Central and State government authorities to file a detailed reply in the court by February 23.</p>
<p>The  petitioner had maintained in the public interest litigation that  Vrindavan has religious importance. The &#8220;Panchkosi Parikrama Marg&#8221;  passes alongside the river and through the ghats. Many pilgrims  undertood the &#8220;parikrama&#8221; barefooted and a few pilgrims even crawled all  the way to offer prayers to Lord Krishna.</p>
<p>The petitioner claimed  that a few persons, in collusion with the authorities, had encroached  upon Yamuna&#8217;s bank by raising constructions, houses, ashrams, hotels,  etc., between the ghats and the river along the Parikrama route in the  flood plain area of the river.</p>
<p>The PIL also contended that the  construction work of the bridge was against the rules of the Indian  Archaeological Act and the same was earlier stopped by the then Mathura  district magistrate.</p>
<p>However, the construction work has restarted  without obtaining the necessary permission from the departments  concerned, the PIL said.</p>
<p>The contention was that to permit  construction alongside the river amounts to breach of the statutory  provision of the Environment (Protection) Act, Water (Prevention and  Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of  Pollution) Act.</p>

<p>The  meeting was started with a word of welcome from Sri Shrivatsa Goswami,  who appreciated Sri Parasuramenen’s agreeing to a meeting on short  notice while on a personal visit to Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa  stated that Vrindavan is unique in its natural heritage, its oral,  spiritual and cultural heritage. Its literature, dance, music, theater,  art and the approach of Bhakti, all have a distinct nature here.</p>
<p>Whilst  he was aware that for those of us who live here it is also our home and  we require the modern amenities of life, he said the aim was to find a  way that the sacred nature of Vrindavan is not lost by unplanned  urbanization. We have to consider that the local people have their needs  and requirements but must also preserve what it is that makes Vrindavan  different from any other place.</p>
<p>The existence of Vrindavan is  because of Krishna, and without Him Vrindavan would not exist. Countless  people visit Vrindavan every year because they are devoted to Krishna.  We are here to play with Krishna Sri Shrivatsa said. He appealed to Sri  Parasuramenen to bring in his and UNESCO’s expertise in giving Vrindavan  world heritage site status.</p>
<p>With this he invited Sri Parasuramenen to speak.</p>
<p>Sri  Parasuramenenji spoke of his intent in returning from Paris where he  was posted, to the land of his ancestors, India. He asked for this  posting as he wished to give back and return to his roots. His ancestors  migrated to Mauritius from Salem in Tamil Nadu in the late 1800’s. He  has always been attracted to the tradition and culture of Krishna.<br />
He  expressed his happiness in being in Vrindavan on a personal visit with  his family and for the opportunity to meet with the citizens of  Vrindavan and hear their views.</p>
<p>Sri Sewak Sharanji was the next  speaker. He said that an ever increasing number of people come here to  find Krishna. We have to save this world heritage, he said, which in  fact is a human sanctuary. Its natural heritage as well as its built  heritage, the man-made architectural sites, are unique here. The natural  heritage of Vrindavan as the place of the lila or play of Radha and  Krishna is most important. Sri Sewak Sharanji said the cultural  development must be parallel with other development. They should not  intersect, nor be in confrontation. He appealed for a plan for Vrindavan  which could be a model for all of Braj as well as for other heritage  towns.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa added here that this is where UNESCO’s  expertise in the realm of conservation and planned development for other  heritage towns and settlements would be most valued.</p>
<p>Sri  Harimohan Malviya, Director of the Vrindavan Research Institute (VRI)  spoke next. He spoke of his sadness at the lack of preservation of the  heritage sites of the great literary geniuses of India, Surdas, Tansen,  and many others who lived and drew their inspiration from Braj. Although  a living centre for Education, Literature and Culture, the Sahitya  Dharma of Braj, its literary tradition is becoming extinct. He made an  appeal that UNESCO’s programs for culture be implemented here. He asked  that the monuments connected to the great litterateurs of Braj be  restored. Sri Parasuramen said that UNESCO will immediately assist in  this venture.</p>
<p>Sri Malaviya also informed that VRI is planning to  hold a multi-disciplinary international conference on the Heritage of  Braj in the coming year and also begining an ambitious project on  preparing an Encyclopeadia of Braj Culture, a collaborative effort of  international scholarship.</p>
<p>Sri Atul Sharma of Gurgaon spoke  next. He stated that the 80 percent of the population of this country,  which is Hindu, lacks a sanctified space for worship. He spoke of  developing proper habitats and shelters for all and the need to create a  slum free environment here in this most holy of holy places for Hindus.</p>
<p>Sri Radhakrishna Pathak spoke next. He too appealed that the  original fabric and roots of Vrindavan be preserved. Vrindavan had its  own municipality since 1865 and he spoke of the new amalgamation of the  muncipality here in Vrindavan with the one in Mathura as a great  mistake.</p>
<p>Sri Parasuramenen said that is a very important mission  of UNESCO to make the intangible cultural traditions of a place  compatible with its tangible physical realities. UNESCO advocates  development and conservation of heritage and promotes eco-tourism.</p>
<p>Sri  Udayan Sharma next warned that the new circular road (bridge) within  the Yamuna stream is against the principles of Vastu. This Keshi Ghat  area, he said, is an important vastu centre for the peninsular nature of  Vrindavan. The bridge will severely affect the vastu of Braj and India.</p>
<p>He said that the local landowners have been cheated of land by  developers from outside who are not acting as stakeholders but are  developing urban housing projects only for personal profit.</p>
<p>He  appealed for a minimum common program to halt the buying of land from  locals as has been done in Uttaranchal. These people do not have a  concept that Braj and Vrindavan have a special global presence.</p>
<p>He  also said that the political development linking the civic bodies of  Mathura and Vrindavan would spoil things further. If Vrindavan is  considered only a small appendage its interests will suffer.</p>
<p>Swami  Sewak Sharan added that it would not only be a historic, administrative  wrong move, but a cultural disaster as well. Mathura from time  immemorial has been representing the urban-city culture, whereas  Vrindavan had been till now a model of natural settlement  (vana-samskriti) and natural heritage.</p>
<p>Sri Pawan and Sri  Shrivatsa said that there was no anti-government attitude here. But the  local voices should always have a say in any developments here.</p>
<p>Sri  Paramadvaiti Swami said this tradition comes from the Vedas. Like the  Vatican, Vrindavan is the centre for those who follow the Vedic  religion. The tradition and culture systems have been preserved here for  thousands of years by the kings of ancient India.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  the political parties have not been sincere or serious to involve local  people in conserving this tradition. All decisions are made by  engineers and experts outside of Braj without a view to preserving the  traditions. If we lose our tradition we lose everything he said, The  government must consult with the local people before they do anything.</p>
<p>Yamuna  and Tulasi are mentioned in the scriptural books as essential for  Krishna‘s presence. This is our faith, he said, so we need to preserve  the Yamuna and the vanas.<br />
Paramadvaita Maharaj also said that tourism  and agriculture are the two most important means of livelihood here.  People come to see the Yamuna, meet saints, and have darshan at the  temples. The businessmen have thrived from this tourism, but the urban  development has led to destruction of both these sites and of the  agricultural tradition.</p>
<p>Developers are furthermore exploiting  the sentiments of the people who come here to live, to be close to the  temples of their faith or to retire and even die here.<br />
More people  are coming than ever before and more will come. So development has to be  planned. Sewage systems don’t exist—all the sewage goes into the  Yamuna. There has to be planned infrastructure. We need the citizens to  unite. We need UNESCO’s intervention he said.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa spoke  of the urgency of having a comprehensive planning process in the  Vrindavan spirit. We are losing good will towards Vrindavan, he said, as  the present government in UP has been very generous in making a huge  grant for developing Vrindavan and Braj. But the lack of a blueprint or  good decisions by the local administration and the failure to utilize  this interest properly is a waste of the generous aid that is being  offered.</p>
<p>As a group, Sri Shrivatsa said, we want the cooperation  and guidance of UNESCO. UNESCO’s efforts for the Taj, Hampi  (Vijaynagar), etc., have made them what they are today—World Heritage  Sites. He makes this appeal on behalf of Vrindavan; in fact on behalf of  all Brajvasis, on behalf of all of Braj Mandala, which is one unit. He  appealed to Sri Parasuramenen to help this movement gel and guide us in  developing right systems for town planning, water management, traffic  management, etc.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa introduced Jagannath Poddar of  Friends of Vrindavan, which collects 1/3rd of the waste from the  Vrindavan municipal area and also voluntarily disposes of biomedical  waste from 103 hospitals and medical clinics in the Mathura-Vrindavan  area.</p>
<p>Jagannath Poddar replied to Shrivatsaji’s question if  Vrindavan had an eco city status saying that there was such a plan, put  forward by the Central Pollution Board in cooperation with GTZ, a German  group, but it fell through. The only holy place that was able to get  this status is Tirupati. The plan required a 50-50 partnership between  the municipality and the CPB, and this could not happen in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Sri  Shrivatsa also inquired about Tourism Master Plan of Braj Region  prepared by IL&amp;FS and The Braj Foundation under MVDA being  sanctioned and implemented as per the newspaper reports. Sri Padmanabh  Goswami replied that it is yet to be sanctioned. Sri Shrivatsa said that  this is just as well, as this permits further input to be taken from  the various groups serving the cause of proper conservation and  development in Braj. Hence the urgency of preparing comprehensive plans  as per the world heritage site guidelines of UNESCO.</p>
<p>Sri  Parasuramenen thanked all for the information he received at the  meeting. He said on behalf of UNESCO that he was definitely interested  in serving Braj. He reported that two letters have already been sent:  One from his predecessor to the Chairman the UP State Advisory Board in  May 2009 expressing concern and offering UNESCO’s technical support, the  other written by him in December 2009.</p>
<p>UNESCO has the technical  expertise to look at a plan and to ensure participation of the  community. He offered to sensitize various contacts in the government  and media about the issue.</p>
<p>Sri Parasuramenen said as the  custodian of promotion and preservation efforts as Director of UNESCO,  his presence is clear indication of their support.</p>
<p>After getting  invitation from the citizens and the local bodies like Nagarapalika  Parishad, he offered to bring experts from various field of heritage  planning to Vrindavan for workshop and a formal meeting. In the  meantime, experts from UNESCO could visit Vrindavan and Vrindavan  citizens would be welcome to his office in Delhi for consultations.</p>
<p>He  also said he would come officially with specialists from all the five  areas of work where UNESCO is active and this multi-speciality team of  experts would discuss the whole issue with stakeholders here.</p>
<p>To  Sri Shrivatsa&#8217;s suggestion that the next formal meeting with UNESCO be  held at Vrindavan Research Institute, Shri Malaviya agreed and Sri  Parasuramen said UNESCO would co- sponsor the event and for which he  will arrange Hindi-English interpreters, and hoped that the formal  meeting would lead to some concrete follow-up action.<br />
He appreciated  that there is a common concern. A larger consensus, he said, can be  built at different levels, local, state and central.</p>
<p>He said he  would propose concrete support for harmonious development. UNESCO works  in holistic tourism and wants that the heart of Vrindavan, the local  people, be benefited. He assured everyone of his personal engagement in  this.</p>
<p>It was resolved that Nagar Palika Parishad of Vrindavan be  the empowered developmental authority, together with MVDA and citizens,  and that they should all be invited to the formal meeting at VRI  sometime in mid-February 2010.</p>
<p>All the members present resolved to come together as partners in the service of Vrindavan and Braj Mandala.</p>
<p>Sri  Padmanabh Goswami thanked Sri Parasuramen on behalf of the citizens and  NGOs of Vrindavan for his willingness to serve the cause of Vrindavan  and Braj.</p>

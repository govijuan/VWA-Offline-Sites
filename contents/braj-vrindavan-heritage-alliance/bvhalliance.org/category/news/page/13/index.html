This  is not too bad, on the whole, if you consider the population of the  country. In a proportional environmental impact ranking, which takes  population factors into account, India ranks much lower.</p>
<p>The  study uses seven indicators of environmental degradation: natural forest  loss, habitat conversion, marine captures, fertilizer use, water  pollution, carbon emissions and species threat. Unlike existing  rankings, this study deliberately avoided human health and economic  data, and instead focused on environmental impact only. Other  variables–bushmeat harvest, coral reef habitat quality, seagrass loss,  freshwater habitat degradation, illegal fishing, invertebrate threat  patterns, and some forms of greenhouse gas emission–were excluded due to  a lack of country-specific data.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-yohai8GUI/AAAAAAAABIs/2B-ocl2mMy4/s1600/india.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5470932939363326274" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-yohai8GUI/AAAAAAAABIs/2B-ocl2mMy4/s400/india.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>According  to the Wall Street Journal, in an effort to boost food production, win  farmer votes and encourage the domestic fertilizer industry, the  government has increased its subsidy of urea fertilizer over the years,  and now pays about half of the domestic industry’s cost of production.  The overuse of urea is so degrading the soil that yields on some crops  are falling–landing <strong>India is 2nd place for environmental impact due to fertilizer use.</strong></p>
<p>India ranks <strong>3rd for water pollution</strong> as increasing competition for water among various sectors, including  agriculture, industry, domestic, drinking, energy generation and others,  is causing this precious natural resource to dry up–while increasing  pollution is also leading to the destruction of the habitat of wildlife  that lives in waterways.</p>
<p>India comes in 8th for another three areas: <strong>threatened species, marine capture and CO2 emissions.</strong></p>

Dr. Dutta is a leading member of the <a href="http://rowfoundation.org/1">Yamuna Foundation for Blue Water</a>. He is quoted in the Hindustan Times, Jan. 14, 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>I  am alarmed at the rising amount of garbage in the Yamuna bed. There is  polythene, material related to religious events dumped on the riverbed  that cause irreparable harm to the river ecosystem. The decaying  polythene bags submerged in the riverbed decay and this leads to the  formation of the chemical Phthalate which is harmful in combination with  water. Such garbage needs to be removed from the river.</p></blockquote>

However, <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/05/jagannath-poddar-and-friends-of.html">Jagannath Poddar of Friends of Vrindavan</a> points out that though the issue galvanized foreign opinion, as seen on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=219561754957&amp;ref=ts">Save Yamuna Save Vrindavan Facebook page</a>,  locally it has not had the same effect. Part of the reason is that  there has been no real concerted effort to get the message out to  Vrindavan residents explaining the consequences of the bridge and the  rest of the unbridled development in the town. And there has also been  the deliberate spreading of misunderstanding regarding two of the  important figures in this whole story.</p>
<div>
<div>Former Punjab DGP <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=219561754957&amp;ref=ts#%21/pages/KPS-GILL/109030785783362?ref=search&amp;sid=1622852566.417699707..1">K.P.S. Gill</a> and Ms. Chandi Heffner of the medical NGO <a href="http://cdhinternational.org/About Us.htm">CDH International</a>,  the owner of the Keshi Ghat, along with Padmanabh and Chandan Goswamis,  who run the most prominent Yamuna Arati at Keshi Ghat, were the first  who sounded the alarm about the bridge. Had they not done so, it is  unlikely that any response would have taken place. Shrivatsa Goswami  also became involved, and some local environmentalists like Sewak  Sharanji as well as foreign sadhus like Paramadvaiti Maharaja also took  part at this beginning stage. There was very little involvement from the  Vrindavan grassroots.</p>
<p>The reason for this is fairly simple.  Local people, led by the vested development interests, including various  government organizations, see Mr. Gill and Ms. Chandi as primarily  protecting their own personal property and not having a real concern for  the global welfare of Vrindavan. The bridge project was being sold to  them as beneficial to the economic development of the town as a whole.  So it was popularly framed as a selfish millionaire outsider obstructing  a plan that would be of benefit to the greater mass of local people.</p>
<p>This  is of course a total distortion. Certainly there is an element of truth  in that Gill, Chandi and Padmanabh Goswami all have some personal  interest in seeing the blight of the bridge not disfiguring their front  yard, but they are wise enough to recognize that this disfigurement  affects far more than themselves. They just happen to be in the front  line.</p>
<p>Mr. Gill has invested a great deal of time, money and used  his considerable  personal influence to make numerous gains in stopping  the construction. He even  started a community organization, the <a href="http://www.yvhf.wordpress.com/">Yamuna Vrindavan Heritage Foundation</a>,  at the end of 2009 and held a handful  of meetings at Keshi ghat. Only a  few days after this, the BVHA was started by  other interests in  Vrindavan, a move that understandably made Mr. Gill feel that his  efforts to reach out to Vrindavan stakeholders was in vain.</p>
<p>At  least the BVHA has been able to take root, allowing for a wider movement   towards the preservation of Vrindavan&#8217;s environment and cultural  heritage.  Without such a broad-based, widely popular awareness of what  is at stake, there  is no possibility of Vrindavan taking any change of  direction.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/28/images/2005072811820101.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img src="http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/28/images/2005072811820101.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanwar_Pal_Singh_Gill">Mr. Gill</a>, whose role in the suppression of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement">Khalistan movement</a> in the 1980&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s made him something of a national hero, and who  has continued to be a prominent leader in anti-terrorism politics, and  has even been awarded the Padma Shri, India&#8217;s 4th-highest civilian  honor, for  his work in the civil service, is nevertheless a  controversial figure locally.</div>
<div>There may be  many reasons for this. One may be that he is a Sikh, meaning that his  religious attachment to Vrindavan is suspect. He is also an outsider, a  Punjabi and not a native of Vrindavan. His background in the Punjab  police forces and anti-terrorism squads, rather than making him a hero,  has had the effect of turning him into a bit of a mysterious and alien  figure, especially as he is often surrounded by bodyguards. Finally, he  is associated with Chandi Heffner, a wealthy foreign woman, and this  makes him game for all manner of jealousy and rumor.</p>
<p>Moreover,  since the YVHF, Mr. Gill has not made any real attempt to win local   public opinion, but has decided to fight his battle against the bridge  entirely behind the scenes and in the courts.</p>
<p>Ms. Heffner also  seeks to preserve her privacy, even though she has been using her  considerable private means for bringing medical care to surrounding  villages, feeding Vrindavan beggars and stray animals on a regular  basis, etc. Her direct support made much of the primary courtcase  research into the environmental and heritage situation possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  the investment she has made on refurbishing and renovating the  Bharatpur kings&#8217; Keshi Ghat temple and residence, etc., is a marvelous  bit of legitimate development in Vrindavan, of which we would like to  see more. Unfortunately, this is not the public opinion. It is the  commonly held idea that the rich  foreign lady took over part of Keshi  Ghat and gutted it, building it to her own  liking. Once again, this is  completely false. Ms. Heffner did a great deal of  research to learn  exactly how the building used to appear so she could restore  it as  faithfully as possible to its original state.</p></div>
<div>
Now the  numerous misconceptions about Mr. Gill and Ms. Heffner might be entirely  inconsequential, except for the fact that the battle for public opinion  is a crucial one.  The good that one does is often only as effective as  the public&#8217;s appreciation of it. And the current situation is that  neither Gill nor Chandi are seen in a positive light by the majority of  Vrindavan&#8217;s population, especially where the bridge issue is concerned.  And, by extension, anyone who supports their position with regards the  bridge is seen as having been &#8220;bought&#8221; or influenced by them.</p>
<p>In  fact, the bridge issue has become so associated with Mr. Gill&#8217;s name  that almost any mention of it immediately produces a visceral reaction  in the minds of many local people. This is in fact made worse by the  fact that Western voices, like mine and Paramadvaiti Maharaj&#8217;s, are also  seen as being outsiders&#8217; voices and therefore suspect.</p>
<p>At any  rate, whatever has happened has happened. The important thing now is to  keep our eye on the ball and not let personal failures get in the way of  the real goal, which is the common interest of all Vrajavasis, and by  extension, all devotees around the world. The fact is that influential  and competent individuals like Mr. Gill and Chandi Heffner are an  invaluable asset to this cause, and no amount of personal flaws, real or  imagined, can detract from their extremely worthwhile service to  Vrindavan Dham.</p></div>

<div>One  of the consequences of the destruction of forest in Vrindavan is the  increased infestation of monkeys in the urban area. Whether there is a  relationship between the recent chopping down of more than 1500 full  sized trees in two highway widening schemes and the increase in monkey  (rhesus macaque) problems in the town cannot be stated, but there is no  doubt that the problem has increasingly been coming to the fore, with  regular reports in the local press of various incidents.</div>
<div>The  streets are narrow, the monkeys are adept at snatching things and have  become emboldened in the past few years. Whereas only certain parts of  the town were danger zones even a few years ago, now one has to pay  attention almost everywhere in the central part of town.</div>
<div>Horror  stories abound. Just a few minutes&#8217; conversation with anyone will  reveal numerous accounts of dangerous encounters with the  animals&#8211;monkey pushing or frightening people so that they fall from  rooftops, spontaneously biting people severely, even in open public  places like Seva Kunj. And if one goes with a monkey bite to the  hospital, he must now be checked and inoculated not just for rabies, but  for HIV also.</p>
<p>Problems in Vrindavan are rife, an rapid  urbanization and tourism are the principal reasons for the general  environmental degradation. But the people see the monkey problem as one  that needs immediate resolution.</p></div>
<div>
<div>It is clear that  this problem is not confined to Vrindavan alone. Several major cities  like Delhi and Jaipur are affected by the &#8220;monkey menace.&#8221; Recent  elections in Uttarakhand saw the inclusion of monkey control as part of  the election manifesto of major political parties for the first time. In  particular, though, Himachal Pradesh has been in the forefront in India  of responding to the difficulty.</div>
<div>In November 2003, the  Himachal Pradesh High Court, in response to public interest litigation  (PIL), criticized the state government for not doing enough to contain  the monkey “menace.” This led to the state&#8217;s forest department and MOEF  submitting the ‘Action Plan to Tackle the Monkey Menace in Shimla and  Shimla Kalka Highway&#8217;.</div>
<div>This led to another PIL on the  national level in the Supreme Court in April 2004, and the federal  ministry&#8217;s submission of a “National Action Plan for Controlling [the]  Stray Animal Menace (monkeys, dogs, cattle and pigs).” As this PIL was  related to the Himachal Pradesh situation, the federal plan seems to  have been a hastily cobbled together copy of the state plan.  Furthermore, though the HP action plan has resulted in action, little  evidence is there that the federal initiative has gone anywhere.</div>
<div>So  what to do? On the whole, there seem to be three solutions: culling or  killing the critters, translocating them, or sterilization.</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Culling</strong> is not really an option. It would go against the wishes of most people  living here. Besides the fact that there is a deep-seated idea of  Hanuman as a sacred creature, Hindus in general are not in favor of  killing. A poll in Himachal Pradesh showed that only 24% of people were  in favour of this solution in their area.</div>
<div>Watching the  beauty of these monkey&#8217;s jumping and playing, it is hard not to admire  the workings of nature in them, despite their rather unpleasant  character. It is hard to blame them for their situation, which is the  result of human depradations more than anything else.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Translocation</strong>. This simply moves the problem elsewhere, and besides there is no nearby habitat to which monkeys could reasonably be sent.</p>
<p>This  was the first solution attempted in Shimla after the abovementioned  PIL. About 3,400 monkeys were translocated from various troublespots to  rural areas. But not long afterward, in December 2006, about 9,000  farmers took to the streets to protest that the urban monkeys were  damaging their crops.</p></div>
<div>Animal rights activists complained  that the monkeys were being mindlessly shifted to unsuitable habitat  areas. As Sujoy Chaudhuri, a environmental and wildlife activist writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite  giving the appearance of performing an animal welfare service by  “giving them a second chance,” translocation, in the words of Wolfgang  Dittus, a primatologist with the Smithsonian Institute, &#8220;is a political  solution, not a biological one: it is a coward&#8217;s way of killing the  animals” because survival rates among translocated animals is extremely  low. (<a href="http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/node/37114">Monkey relocation plan: Urban Bias? Sujoy Chaudhuri (Indian Environmental Portal)</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Other  concerns are the urban monkeys could spread their diseases to the wild  monkeys living in the forests, some of which are rare and even  endangered species.</p>
<p>Wildlife conservationists also feel that  there is an urban bias in translocation plans, which define the problem  only in terms of biting, harassment and the destruction of property in  cities. Unless rural populations are favorably disposed to preserving  wildlife, it will be an impossibility, and the problems created by crop  raiding, etc., by moving monkeys to rural areas will erode any positive  feelings rural people have for wildlife.</p></div>
<div>In the specific  circumstances of Vrindavan, it would be hard to assess where the monkeys  could be sent in any case as there are no reasonably nearby forested  areas to speak of.</div>
<div>(3) <strong>Sterilization</strong>, which seems  to be the only other option, has been tested in several places, but the  full consequences or success or failure of the programs are not yet  known.</p>
<p>After the failure of the translocation scheme in HP, the  government went on a war footing in January 2008 in a fairly widely  publicized sterilization effort. Rs. 8.3 million was set aside for the  job. The wildlife department purchased two laser sterilization machines,  and the plan was for a mobile van to go around Shimla in search of  dominant male monkeys to sterilize them on the spot, inside the vehicle.  It was also sold as an employment scheme.</p>
<p>A more recent article from June 27, 2009, (<a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Himachal+Pradesh+sterilizes+monkeys+to+check+their+population-a0202500262">Himachal Pradesh sterilizes monkeys to check their population</a>)  indicates that the HP forest department is continuing with the  sterilization program. They claim to that they have deployed a team of  doctors (I assume veterinarians) to sterilize around 5,000 monkeys and  have a target of sterilizing another 75,000 monkeys over the next 2-3  years. (According to another source, there are approximately 300,000  monkeys altogether in HP.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This year we are  targeting to sterilize 20,000 monkeys. Next year we will target to  sterilize 25,000 monkeys. We believe that in next 2-3 years, we will be  able to sterilize around 75,000 monkeys. It will bring a meaningful  difference if we achieve this target,&#8221; said J.P Nadda, Forest Minister,  Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>The department is adopting laser therapy to  sterilize monkeys, which they consider to be more effective than other  techniques available for sterilization. Authorities have strictly banned  feeding of the brown, rhesus monkeys &#8211; a favourite pastime of most  tourists.</p>
<p>&#8220;In zoos of Germany and some other European countries,  the sterilization process involves placing a chip in monkeys. The chip  has to be placed every three years. There are some other techniques for  sterilization too but they are effective for short term. Our  sterilization method is for life long,&#8221; said Dr. Sandeep, an expert in  monkey sterilization.</p></blockquote>
<p>A similar sterilization program is  apparently underway in Lobpuri, a temple town in Thailand with a tourist  industry and a similar macaque problem. According to the <a href="http://monkeydaynews.blogspot.com/2009/08/thailand-launches-primate-birth-control.html">report</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Every  day, a team of vets marches into alleyways, armed with candy bags to  tempt the monkeys, who are then captured and operated on. At least half  of the 1,500 male macaques are expected to be sterilized as part of the  program. Male monkeys can mate 10 times a day and females can give birth  twice a year. The sterilization procedure takes around half an hour.  The monkeys are released back into their concrete jungle the next day,  after they have recovered.</p></blockquote>
<p>Environmentalists and wildlife  experts like Sujoy Chaudhuri and Belinda Wright, the director of the  Wildlife Protection Society of India, have offered objections which  center on inadequate training of the sterilizers, as the sterilizing  equipment “requires a huge amount of expertise.” They expressed fears  that it would do nothing to contain the problem and probably make it  worse. “Can you imagine what having badly-sterilized monkeys running  around will do to the levels of aggression?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the above cited article from Indian Environmental Portal, Chaudhuri clarifies this objection:</p></div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Astonishingly,  the national plan suggests that male sterilisations be conducted to  control the conflict. Because monkeys are polygynous (females mate with  many males), it is females that need to be targeted for sterilisation.  The national plan, however, claims that the sterilisation of males makes  greater economic sense because there are apparently fewer males.  Anyway, sterilisation is a long-term population stabilisation measure  and can do little to contain the immediate conflict: sterilised monkeys  can bite as hard as non-sterilised ones, and can raid crop fields with  equal ease.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JHE/JHE-30-0-000-10-Web/JHE-30-2-000-2010-Abst-PDF/JHE-30-2-105-10-2051-Chauhan-A/JHE-30-2-105-10-2051-Chauhan-A-Tt.pdf">survey of public opinion (PDF)</a> published in February this year, regarding sterilization conducted in  Himachal Pradesh, there was strong favorability to sterilization as the  best solution to the problem.</p>
<p>The summary of that survey: 75%  were favorable to sterilization, 90% agreed to a feeding ban. Other  solutions such as patrolling by dogs, better control of waste, etc.,  were not deemed viable by the majority. But 90% agreed that government  should do something.</p>
<p>This recent article states that Simla now  has 800 monkeys in what is a much larger town than Vrindavan. I would  not hesitate to estimate the monkey population here to be in excess of  800. But judging from the data gathered in the various articles, 800  already represents a considerable reduction from the numbers that were  present at the beginning of the project.</p></div>
<div>I have written to  the Himachal Pradesh government asking for further information about  their monkey sterilization project and to the environmentalists who  spoke out against it for further information.</div>

			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/yamuna-bridge-updates-from-katie/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>The following update has been sent to us by Katie Jo Walter, whose  research work has brought her to Vrindavan. Now she has been dragged  into actively helping the various causes that are of primary interest to  the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance&#8211;the environment and Vrindavan&#8217;s  sacred heritage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Greetings to all and Radhe Radhe! I  wanted to post an update on the bridge situation. Some developments are  a bit fuzzy in detail, but I wanted to pass on what is known.</p>
<p>First  of all, the last judgment by the Allahabad high court regarding the  bridge lifted the stay based on plans showing the bridge crossing the  Yamuna. Apparently, no such plan was submitted and the true plan (the  one showing the bridge going in a semicircle in front of the ghat) was  the one placed before the judge for scrutiny. I have heard from two  separate sources deeply involved in the legal struggle that this judge  was under a great deal of pressure and so made this false statement  about the evidence placed before him.</p>
<p>The good news is that this  leaves the door wide open for the case to be taken to another court.  Supposedly the judge worded his ruling in such a way so as to make  further litigation possible – he simply could not handle the case any  longer himself.</p>
<p>SO &#8211; Now there is a new public interest  litigation petition. This litigation also calls for the clearing of all  construction waste from the bridge and to have the Yamuna returned to  the ghats. This case was heard briefly on Friday before being postponed  to Monday. I will update this page on Monday with the court case  information as soon as it is posted.</p>
<p>Additionally, rumor has it  that Jaypee Construction is hurting for funding as it tries to complete  the massive Yamuna Expressway group of projects. It is said that their  payments to subcontractors are in arrears and that they are demanding 3  crore Rs from the state to restart work on the bridge. The state is not  willing to do this, so this is another reason for things being at a  standstill (or so I was told). The following links show just how large  and how expensive this group of projects is for Jaypee. It also gives us  a glimpse into the future of toll roads and yet more real estate  expansion:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livemint.com/2010/04/29222154/Jaypee-Infra-goes-public-prof.html">Jaypee Infra Goes Public</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.livemint.com/2010/04/29222154/244A138C-7890-4C18-8569-955835AD560CArtVPF.pdf">Cost of Yamuna Expressway Project</a></p>
<p>Last  but not least, there is the update to the Ancient Monuments and  Archaeological Remains Act of 1958 which passed in parliament last  month. This act does not allow ANY construction within 300 meters of a  monument protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The  bridge is currently situated at 107 meters from Jugal Kishore Mandir.  Before this new amendment, projects could get clearance from regional  and national ASI offices by obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC).  This process has now been completely done away with. Furthermore, no new  constructions are allowed to take place at all until all pertinent  bylaws to this amendment have been formulated. The director of ASI,  people in the Architectural Heritage Department of INTACH and others  have expressed the view that since this bridge has not yet been built,  it will not be allowed to be fully constructed in light of this new law.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/news/640278_Encroachment-on-249-centrally-protected-monuments">an interesting article</a> about just how many ASI monuments are being encroached upon (UP leads the list, go figure).</p>
<p>Here the regulated area should be read as 200 meters additional to the first 100 meters.</p>
<p>I  hope this helps to give everyone some hope, even though it contains  fewer details than we all would like. As I said before, I will post the  results of the latest Public Interest Litigation case on Monday. If  anyone wishes to comment or correct me on anything, please do so on the  Save Yamuna to Save Vrindavan Faceboook page and&#8211;or discussion board.</p>
<p>Jai Yamuna Maharani,<br />
Katie</p></blockquote>
<p>Many  people have been inquiring about the current situation with the bridge,  especially since most have heard that the stay order was lifted.  However, as Katie shows here, things are a little more complicated than  that and no new work has been begun since then.</p>
<p>For all intents  and purposes, for various reasons, the project seems to have hit a wall.  The various opponents to the bridge are not letting down their  offensive and are striking from different angles, keeping up the  pressure. Supporters of the bridge are doing the best they can, but it  appears that they are somewhat in disarray.</p>
<p>Not that the forces  of Kali-yuga should be underestimated. Kaliyuga can come in the form of  sadhus, santas, Brajavasis, and well-wishers of various stripes, as well  as politicians and materialistic business people.</p>
<p>Vrindavan&#8217;s  problems are enormous. The infrastructure is totally inadequate, and  most efforts to improve it seem to be haphazard, totally misguided and  without any concept of how the best interests of the people will be  served. Garbage removal is left in the hands of a few NGO&#8217;s whose  capacities are stretched beyond limit. Traffic is being channeled into  the center of town where it will simply create havoc.</p>
<p>No  attempts are being made to beautify or preserve the few green or  potentially green areas. Little effort is being made by the public  sector to intervene and make the most of the heritage buildings and  temples. Since the Yamuna flows through an important part of North  India, including the capital city, some people are taking notice of its  pathetic condition and so consciousness is being raised. But this is  simply one of many fronts on which consciousness has to be raised and  multiple efforts made.</p>
<p>As Sewak Sharan said to us yesterday: the  economic interest of Vrindavan is destroyed if the two elements on which  it stands are destroyed: the environment and the sacred heritage, both  of which are interdependent. The environment has nearly been destroyed.  The latest road widening on the Mathura-Vrindavan highway led to 800  trees being chopped down. The widening of the road to Chattikara  similarly led to hundreds of trees being lost.</p>
<p>Jagannath Poddar  tells me that the few neem trees that line the Bhaktivedanta Marg are  going to be saved, but I would guess that they are still at risk. At any  rate, tree planting is a lot more than putting a seed in the ground&#8230;  it takes years of watering and protection. How will these many thousands  of trees be replaced?</p>
<p>I hope that all of the people who read  this Facebook page will recognize that the Bridge was just an issue that  served the function of a &#8220;final straw.&#8221; We are going to have to get  ready to volunteer on many, many levels in many, many areas, to create a  Vrindavan in which the sacred heritage and the sacred environment are  recognized and treated as such by residents and visitors alike.</p>

<div>Look  at the size and beauty of those trees. Even the tank waters are fairly  clean. The perimeter wall has been breached, which means that this  protected area has lost its protection.</div>

<div>Two  samadhis which seem fairly recent. I don&#8217;t know anything about the  ashram and there seemed to be no one about. It was after lunch, so I  will have to go back at a more social hour to find out a little about  the ashram&#8217;s history.</div>

<div>In  a pessimistic mood, one is almost impelled to cry out, &#8220;How long?&#8221; This  area is a jewel and should be preserved before some greedy person  starts seeing dollar signs and hearing the jingling of cash.<br />

These two pictures  immediately show us why it is so difficult to raise consciousness on  environmental issues in India.</p>
<p>Just next to Jiva in Sheetal Chaya  are three small bastis of Bengali rickshaw wallahs. They are very poor  and I believe they are living in these private properties by the grace  of the owners, who probably think it better to have them squat there  until they decide to develop the land. At any rate, the grounds are  walled off and fairly spacious. For poor people, they are actually quite  well set up in comparison to many. They don&#8217;t have access to water and  have to come to Jiva for both kinds of water and you can see in the  picture the containers they use.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WDf4bLJzI/AAAAAAAABGM/Bk6_HrVIKPY/s1600/SDC10705.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468921906256881458" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WDf4bLJzI/AAAAAAAABGM/Bk6_HrVIKPY/s400/SDC10705.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
What  is painful to observe is how they have so little thought for their  communal grounds. Everyone is using the central part of the property for  cleaning and bathing, etc., and yet they make no effort to drain or  clean it. So basically, they are living in the midst of a disease and  mosquito producing swamp of their own making and are not lifting a  finger to improve their surroundings.</p>
<p>Now this is just one case,  but you could multiply it a million times in India. It is a complete  absence of a sense of the common good. No politician in India can appeal  to the common good. It is always communalism or vested interest. Except  perhaps in cases like national defense or something. But where does the  construction of a social fabric begin? Why does someone have to come  from outside to say, &#8220;Friends, you are creating an environment that will  produce disease. Just a small effort from all of you together could  clean this up, make it nice for the children to play, maybe even make a  vegetable garden or something possible&#8221;?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WRtJsJ56I/AAAAAAAABIM/2xPUFHooi7s/s1600/SDC10723.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468937527392593826" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WRtJsJ56I/AAAAAAAABIM/2xPUFHooi7s/s400/SDC10723.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
I  feel that this is a result of the caste system, but that is practically  speaking irrelevant. But if the poor cannot lift a finger to work  together for their own common good, or even conceive of the problem,  which seems so glaringly obvious, it staggers the imagination to see how  the society as a whole will find the will to collectively deal with  these problems as they manifest globally.</p>
<p>The thing is that  education on its own is not enough. It will take generations to instill  the kind of civic sense that most of us in the West take for granted.</p>
<p>Here is another case in point:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WDgfNYExI/AAAAAAAABGU/1O17d5y-piE/s1600/SDC10711.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468921916667990802" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WDgfNYExI/AAAAAAAABGU/1O17d5y-piE/s400/SDC10711.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
Along  the Parikrama Marg between Mathura Road and the railway tracks is the  Tuberculosis Hospital. This was built about 25-30 years ago, or at least  considerably expanded at that time. The wall that surrounds the  property extends for several hundred meters along the Marg.</p>
<p>The  walls were nicely painted and hundreds of couplets in simple Hindi  giving good advice about health and tips about how to recognize TB or  HIV were inscribed for its entire length. Such signs, whose  effectiveness is debatable, are a frequently used tactic in attempts to  create public awareness of environmental and health issues.  Nevertheless, to me, such well-meaning and useful advice, such as the  one we see here, &#8220;If your cough persists for more than two weeks, go and  get it checked by a doctor,&#8221; are practically sacred in their intent and  public value.</p>
<p>Here you can see that the original couplets have  been papered over a hundred times by people advertising all manner of  products, from sadhus to schools and soap. In fact, this one may be less  damaged than many of the others. Did no one stop to think that the  messages that benefited the population as a whole and served as  permanent and constant reminders as to how their health and quality of  life could be improved were more important than their own fleeting  personal need for publicity?</p>
<p>Now of course, the battle has been  lost. The messages have been destroyed and all we have left is the  tattered remnants of calls to hear Bhagavata saptahas that have long  been forgotten.</p>
<p>And here, I couldn&#8217;t resist this sign pointing to Avadhuta Ashram, 200 meters.</p>

Ranchor Prime&#8217;s account of the beginnings of the  formation of <a href="http://www.fov.org.uk/history/history.html">Friends of Vrindavan</a> talks extensively about how he first got involved and lists some of his early contributions.</div>
<div>Sewak Sharan was not feeling particularly well, though he told us that his general health is, thankfully, good.</div>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WN2jgxwKI/AAAAAAAABIE/0eG0VNJilQQ/s1600/SDC10708.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468933290896507042" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WN2jgxwKI/AAAAAAAABIE/0eG0VNJilQQ/s400/SDC10708.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<div>Sewak  Sharanji&#8217;s ashram is fairly large, by Vrindavan standards, and shows  his concern for trees (mostly neem) and the environment.  It has that  Vrindavan feel to it. I think it is because there is no grass.</div>
<div>His main point is that Vrindavan&#8217;s heritage <em>is</em> its natural environment. Sharanji is a real nature bhakta. His deity is  even called &#8220;Radha Paryavaran Bihari&#8221;, or Radha and Krishna, &#8220;who plays  in the natural environment.&#8221; It is a modern term, <em>paryavarana</em>, which means &#8220;environment,&#8221; but for Sewak, it refers right back to Braja, synonymous with it.</div>
<div>This  was a forest, and efforts should be made to bring back that original  natural ambience. Braj and Vrindavan&#8217;s economy is strongly dependent on  tourism or pilgrimage. But with the progressive destruction of the  natural, traditional environment, not only is there a degradation of  lifestyle, but it dooms the very economic basis.</div>
<div>It  is like cutting off the branch of a tree one is sitting on. Already,  many people who come from Delhi or elsewhere to get a taste of  Vrindavan&#8217;s devotional ambiance leave disappointed. There are no  peaceful gardens, no <em>dhira samira yamuna tira, </em>no quiet breezes  on the banks of the Yamuna. What they get is honked at in traffic jams  or nearly run over, overflowing sewage drains, filthy dogs and pigs  rubbing up against them, beggars, monkeys, and piles of garbage that  seem destined to never be removed. And current development plans are all  either halfhearted or totally misguided.</div>
<div>I  called Vrindavan a test case, by which I meant that if we cannot do it  here, if we cannot revive ecological awareness here where the forest is  traditionally sacred, where Lord Krishna appears in order to cavort with  the gopis, then how will it be possible elsewhere, where there is no  such consciousness?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WN1xxtj-I/AAAAAAAABH0/SvzsKcwfgUU/s1600/SDC10709.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468933277545762786" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WN1xxtj-I/AAAAAAAABH0/SvzsKcwfgUU/s400/SDC10709.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>What  we really need to do is create a publication that educates the people  at large about the ideal of Vrindavan. We discussed this point to some  extent. Sewakji says, &#8220;Vrindavan is the ideal, the model for the world  of how the sacred and the natural come together.&#8221; We had a little  disagreement only to this extent here, in that I said, &#8220;Vrindavan NEEDS  to be a practical example of that, since in the present circumstances it  does not manifest that ideal.&#8221;</div>
<div>But in either  case, for him, the guiding principle has always been, &#8220;What is the use  of my chanting and worship in the temples and bathing daily in the  Yamuna, if I cannot protect these trees and animals which are a part of  my devotion?&#8221; Sewak means &#8220;servant.&#8221; Sharan means &#8220;shelter.&#8221; He lives up  to his name by recognizing that devotion means taking shelter of  service.</p>

This  is point of this Braja Vrindavan Heritage Alliance. Sharanji has been  working tirelessly since his retirement to make ecological issues</div>
<div>
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WN1NamxGI/AAAAAAAABHk/zFqG_Sgl-xg/s1600/SDC10710.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468933267785172066" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-WN1NamxGI/AAAAAAAABHk/zFqG_Sgl-xg/s400/SDC10710.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>As  far as I can see, there is no difference between Krishna consciousness  and service to Vrindavan, in these two aspects: its natural and cultural  heritage. The pioneer of this service isSewak Sharanji, who has not  given up the fight even in his old age, after 20 years of setbacks and  all too small victories. It is time for more of us younger folks to come  to the fore and make this OUR fight.</div>
<div>Development  has reached a critical level of intensity, especially in this year of  the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, and if we do not push back now, we may  lose the battle forever.</div>
<div>Vrindavan may be just  one corner of the battle for making the entire earth a place where the  quality of life is perfectly suited to the culture of spirituality, but  for us, it is the central point, the essence of the Earth, the <em>axis mundi</em>. If we who claim to be devotees can&#8217;t do it here, then how can it happen anywhere?</div>

Jagannath is now taking a very active role in the BVHA, which  as yet is a very loose organization, and deliberately so. From the very  beginning, it was decided that until we reached a point where there was  widespread interest and commitment to the BVHA goals, there would be no  official membership or officers, or even a program for fund collection  and so on.</p>
<div>I don&#8217;t know how long this will be able  to go on, for as soon as any real projects are planned, money is needed,  and once money is involved, there has to be an organization accountable  for those moneys. Of course, some of the activities that are going on  now are being paid for directly out of pocket by individual parties, but  that will not be able to continue for long.</p>
<div>The idea  to do the greening of Kishor Van was Jagannath&#8217;s idea, and it is a good  one, as is the current policy of having meetings in different places  every week in order to involve a wider group of people. The Kishor Van  project will also be conducted under the auspices of Friends of  Vrindavan.</div>
<div>Next week, on Wednesday, the BVHA  meeting will be held at Vamshi Bat, and representatives of the various  local temples will be invited.</div>
<div>

As Katie Walter <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/05/yamuna-bridge-updates-from-katie.html">reports</a>,  the Yamuna Bridge issue continues to be fought out in the courts.  However, Jagannath points out that though the issue galvanized foreign  opinion, as seen on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=219561754957&amp;ref=ts">Save Yamuna Save Vrindavan Facebook page</a>,  locally it has not had the same effect. This is problematic. Part of  the reason is that there has been no real concerted effort to get the  message out, but another aspect of it resides in some personal issues.</div>
<div>In  fact, the bridge issue has become so associated with Mr. K.P.S. Gill&#8217;s  name that almost any mention of the bridge immediately produces a  visceral reaction in the minds of many local people. This is in fact  made worse by the fact that Western voices, like mine and Paramadvaiti  Maharaj&#8217;s, are also seen as being outsiders&#8217; voices and therefore  suspect.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Jagannath recognized this  and decided to run a different strategy. As the original members of BVHA  have practically speaking moved into the background, he is in a perfect  position to implement that strategy. The bridge issue has taken a back  seat and the wider issues of heritage and environmental restoration have  taken the fore. Gradually, more people are getting involved and  representatives of many of the major Hindu associations in Vrindavan are  in attendance at BVHA meetings.</div>
<div>It is my hope  that the worldwide interest in Vrindavan&#8217;s future, which was generated  by the bridge issue, will continue even as the acuteness of that problem  recedes or as the responsibility for it continues to be fought in the  courts. In fact, the kinds of letter-writing campaigns that were planned  and to some extent executed in the beginnings of the anti-bridge  movement should by all means continue. But we must recognize that this  is only a symptom and that the battle is a much larger one that will  need to be fought on multiple fronts and over a long period of time:  haphazard road development process, water borne disease, etc. &#8211; take   your pick &#8211; so many VERY important issues to the health of the dham and  its  people.</div>
<div>Even stopping the bridge will only be the equivalent of stopping the bleeding; it will not heal the wound.</div>
<div>===================</div>
<div>Jagannath has been running <a href="http://www.friendsofvrindavan.com/about.htm">Friends of Vrindavan</a> for the last several years. (See also http://www.fov.org.uk/)</div>
<div>The  FOV building is across the street from the Monghyr (or Munger) Raja  temple (Bhaktivedanta Sadhu Maharaj&#8217;s establishment) and was indeed  originally built and owned by one of the Monghyr queens.</div>
<div>

There is still a small Radha-Krishna temple in the building, as you can see here.</div>
<div>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-QnGG_JBZI/AAAAAAAABFM/nQQn1DHwIxY/s1600/SDC10696.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468538833442768274" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-QnGG_JBZI/AAAAAAAABFM/nQQn1DHwIxY/s400/SDC10696.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
The  main FOV activities at present include cleaning some parts of the town  and helping with specific cleaning projects. I personally find this  somewhat improper, as these are jobs that the municipality should be  doing and the involvement of NGO&#8217;s gives the public sector the right to  wash its hands of responsibility. FOV has only limited capacity to clean  the streets and neighborhoods of the town. Some other NGO&#8217;s like Food  For Life Vrindavan (FFLV) are also doing work in this regard, but the  overall effect seem to be minimal.</div>
<div>In fact, it  seems to me that the extent of their work has lessened over the past  few years. At any rate, no one will say that they have been successful  in making Vrindavan a clean place. The reason behind this can be  explained as follows:</div>
<div>Funding for street  cleaning was given to both FFLV and FoV as a pilot project that would   eventually become self sustainable. Therefore, the organizations were  encouraged  to get residents to pay for cleaning services. Most of these  people argue, not unreasonably, that  they should not have to pay  anything extra since they already pay taxes to the municipality.</div>
<div>FoV  was somewhat more successful than FFLV in getting local income, but as  the initial project funding winds  down, neither of the two NGOs has  been able to make the project fully self-sustainable, which means that  costs are being cut. This again results in performance suffering and so  people stop paying due to reduced services.</p>
<p>Mr. Saigal of FFLV  says that  the real problem is that the municipality does not have the  funding to do most  of its work. FFLV even occasionally gives money to  the municipality itself so it can  cover things like hand pumps and even  their own (the municipality&#8217;s) salaries.  Mr. Saigal says that the  municipality principal source of income comes from property taxes and   that this is only collected from the poor people of the town. Temples  and  ashrams have clung to ancient tax codes and furiously refuse to  allow their tax  amounts to be increased.</p></div>
<div>This  is quite rightly unsustainable. Ashram owners and goswamis want change  in Vrindavan and yet do not want to increase their contributions to the   municipality. Here again we have a case of the lack of a civil sense  coming to the fore. As long as things are nice within my four walls, let  the Red Death rage outside!!</div>

<div>This  is not to say that many of FOV&#8217;s initiatives are not good. They have a  paper recycling unit, with which they make colored artisanal paper  products of nice quality. They need a market, so anyone who knows where  such recycled, handmade paper can be sold is welcome to share the  information.</div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-Qm2Hq9dnI/AAAAAAAABE0/dQf3xBKosiQ/s1600/SDC10700.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468538558748653170" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-Qm2Hq9dnI/AAAAAAAABE0/dQf3xBKosiQ/s400/SDC10700.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
As  such, FOV hires quite a few people, I did not get the number. They are  also looking for ways to recycle plastics, making baskets and other  interesting products with the polyethylene bags that are gathered from  the streets. After washing them of course.</div>
<div>

Finally,  it is worth mentioning their worm composting project, which also brings  in some income, as the fertilizer is of high quality. These are all  very admirable projects, whose scope needs considerable widening and  support.</div>
<div>
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-Qm26DsBEI/AAAAAAAABFE/Tio9Ob6ncNs/s1600/SDC10699.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468538572274140226" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-Qm26DsBEI/AAAAAAAABFE/Tio9Ob6ncNs/s400/SDC10699.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
It  may be said that the lack of a central garbage dump (though there is an  official one near the Pagal Baba temple) means that there is little or  no scavenger industry as in most poor countries in the world. One often  hears of the great garbage dumps in Cairo or Manila. But here, the  garbage seems to be evenly distributed in every empty plot of land,  indiscriminately.</div>
<div>I cannot see how there will  be any progress on this front until waste management is conducted  effectively by the muncipality itself.</p>

<div>Construction  of new buildings goes on, of course. I heard from Jagannath Poddar that  the current plan for development of Vrindavan allows for buildings of  up to 12 storeys.</div>

<div>Here,  as elsewhere in many places, there is a great deal of water that seems  to flow unimpeded from leaks in the water supply system. It quickly  turns into a stagnant, stinking mess.</div>

<div>One  sector that is getting a little benefit from the destruction is labor.  It seems that up and down the road, there are people rebuilding walls.  Here you see day laborers waiting on the street for someone to come and  offer them work for the day.</div>

<div>I  wanted to take pictures of the current work that is being done further  down, by the Vidyapith intersection, where huge holes in the ground  completely impede traffic movement. Or further along in the Bhangi Para,  where the accumulation of garbage covers a tennis pitch size of terrain  in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Today&#8217;s paper cited one  neighborhood in another nearby village becoming sick from the detritus.  Has nobody noticed that it is everywhere!!?</div>

<div>It  rained last night and I still haven&#8217;t gone out onto the streets because  I know that the drains cannot handle even a minor rainfall, what to  speak of an out and out thunderstorm.</div>
<div>I think  that Vrindavan must be the most poorly managed town I have ever seen.  This roadwork on the Raman Reti Road has been going on for two years and  there seems to be no progress, only increased deterioration of the  infrastructure. The sewage pipes will lead more effluent directly into  the Yamuna. While protests against the cutting of trees seems to have  stopped the renovation of the road here, they merrily chopped down 800  full growth trees along the Mathura Road to widen it. With global  warming and water table depletion set to affect places like Vrindavan  disproportionately, they blindly keep running down this deathwalk they  call progress.</div>
<div>I suspect that they are trying  to continue the destruction until the people are so frantic that they  will do anything just to get some relief. A kind of &#8220;disaster  capitalism&#8221; in the microcosm.</div>
<div>The thing is that  this road is going to really do nothing except cause more misery. The  traffic will hurtle closer to the center of town where it will again  become jammed up in the narrow streets, making regular pedestrian and  rickshaw traffic near impossible. More and more properties will be  converted into parking lots. The general quality of life will be further  reduced for the benefit of a few fly-by-night tourists and those who  profit from them.</div>
<div>And the thing is that they  are doing nothing to improve or enhance the very core of Vrindavan&#8217;s  real treasures. Indeed, this is all destructive.</div>
<div>I  have to commend the Kishore Van project, and indeed it is important to  restore the wooded areas of old Vrindavan. We have to do something, and  this is something. But there is so much to do that it seems like a drop  in the bucket. This small sacred area&#8211;which thank God no one has  thought should be better made into a parking lot&#8211;needs to recapture the  beauty of Radha and Krishna&#8217;s lila sthalis.  We need to support this  project, but we need to expand.</div>
<div>The most  important thing, as far as I can see, is to work on public opinion. We  need publications in Hindi, we need karmis who will go out, distributing  this material and convincing others, one by one, from the acharyas and  politicians to the businessmen and people on the street, of the  necessity of environmental action, cleanup, heritage preservation, and  an action plan for Vrindavan that takes into account its sacred  character. And this is especially important as so many people who have  come here for work in construction or business and so on <strong>have no real consciousness or affection for Vrindavan as a sacred city</strong>.</div>
<div>Charity begins at home. The preaching of Vrindavan must begin in Vrindavan.</div>
<div>===============</div>
<div>Here  is a common enough sight in the hot season. Dogs wallowing in the water  to cool off. Finding clean water isn&#8217;t easy though, and all the dogs  have black legs and bellies from the muck.</div>

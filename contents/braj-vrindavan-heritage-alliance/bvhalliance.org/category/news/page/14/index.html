Kishor  Van is the place of Hariram Vyasa, a direct disciple of Madhavendra  Puri. He was one of the significant figures on the Vrindavan in the  early 16th century and many of his songs mention gosthis of  Prabodhananda, Rupa, Sanatan, Haridas Swami and Hari Vyas and other  important pioneers of the rasika bhakti movement of the time. Hariram  Vyasa was very close to Hit Harivams, and Kishore Van was originally an  extension of Seva Kunj, but at some point was separated from it by a  wall on the north side. I believe that the Rasa Mandal here was one of  the first if not the very first in Vrindavan.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LBIq8axAI/AAAAAAAABEE/NUDdD5ab7U0/s1600/SDC10682.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468145252292019202" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LBIq8axAI/AAAAAAAABEE/NUDdD5ab7U0/s400/SDC10682.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
I could not get a very good photo of Hariram Vyasji&#8217;s Yugal Kishor deities because of lighting.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LAOjAg6JI/AAAAAAAABD8/NgJFO9pebM0/s1600/SDC10676.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468144253729302674" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LAOjAg6JI/AAAAAAAABD8/NgJFO9pebM0/s400/SDC10676.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<div>Here is his samadhi. Because of monkey problems, everything is covered with layers of grilling.</div>
<div>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LAOM5fvkI/AAAAAAAABD0/w9dF8zvj4W0/s1600/SDC10677.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468144247794286146" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LAOM5fvkI/AAAAAAAABD0/w9dF8zvj4W0/s400/SDC10677.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>Here  you can see out the back into the garden area. Now just over the wall  on the left is Seva Kunj. Seva Kunj, Nidhivan and Kishore Van are the  only three &#8220;green&#8221; garden areas left in Vrindavan, but all of them are  very dry and rather uninviting. Kishore Van is the smallest of the  three. As you can see from this and the picture below, some effort has  been made to plant trees, but there is difficulty getting water into the  vana (there is a dry well on the grounds), and the monkeys are a huge  problem here.</div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LANmpq-RI/AAAAAAAABDs/TJMpf3p4bHs/s1600/SDC10684.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468144237527365906" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LANmpq-RI/AAAAAAAABDs/TJMpf3p4bHs/s400/SDC10684.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>Here  is a picture of the meeting, which was  basically called simply to  announce the project of restoring Kishore Van. Jagannath Poddar of  Friends of Vrindavan resuscitated one of many previously proposed  projects in the hope that the BVHA can demonstrate some accomplishments  and build credibility in that way. We will have occasion to comment  later.</div>
<div>The project proposes covering the entire  ground with some kind of grill to prevent monkeys from coming in. And  of course, planting trees and flower bushes, etc.</div>
<div>
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LANbjQopI/AAAAAAAABDk/pmWxG1-O2ko/s1600/SDC10681.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468144234547683986" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S-LANbjQopI/AAAAAAAABDk/pmWxG1-O2ko/s400/SDC10681.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>Unfortunately  I did not get everyone&#8217;s name and many of the faces were new. It seems  that the BVHA group is getting larger, and new people are coming, but  many of the old faces were absent. Jagannath Poddar and Madhumangal  Shukla are the most prominent individuals who have remained consistently  present and they may be the greatest hope for the BVHA. This meeting  was attended by representatives of several important groups&#8211;the RSS,  the Brahman Mahasabha, the Brajavasi Panda Sabha, the town council, and  others.</div>
<div>On the right above is Acharya Naresh  Narayan, who took a prominent role at the meeting. He is the editor and  publisher of a small weekly newspaper in Hindi called <em>Vrindavan Insaf</em>, which has been publishing stories related to BVHA activities and some other environment related issues.</div>

<div>It  is good that more people are coming. The local press and TV were there  and took pictures and will write something up in tomorrow&#8217;s papers. So  at least that much is being done. It is a beginning. Everybody seems to  be <a href="http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/08/monkeys-on-the-rampage-in-india/">most concerned about the monkeys</a> and even as we did the tour of Kishor Van, one former town councillor,  Pratibha Sharma, had her glasses stolen. I didn&#8217;t see it, coz my glasses  were in my pocket and I am blind as a bat without them. But we have to  look into a sterilization program. Katie says she knows some people&#8230;  Let&#8217;s see.</div>
<div>Latest news of the bridge and courtcases will be coming tomorrow.</div>

<p>Minutes of the meeting of Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance (BVHA)</p>
<p>Place: Kishor Van<br />
Date: 5th May 2010</p>
<p>Present:  Shri Bal Krishna Goutam, Shri Govind Kishor Goswami, Dr. Devendra  Chaitanya Brahmachari, Ms. Nirguna Dasi, Shri Jagadananda Das, Ms. Katie  Walter, Acharya Naresh Narain, Shri Arup Govinda Das, Shri Indra  Pahuja, Shri Krishna Gopal Gupta, Jagannath Poddar, Ms. Pratibha Sharma,  Ms. Sita Agrawal, Shri Ram Narayan Brajwasi, Dr. Chandra Prakash  Sharma, Shri Damodar Sharma, Shri Suresh Vedpathi, Shri Gopal Ji, Shri  Suresh Chandra Sharma, Shri Jagadananda Das, Shri Madhumangal Shukla,  Shri Ravindra Kulshreshtha, Shri Satyamurti Saraswat</p>
<p>Chair:  Thakur Shri Jugal Kishor through His servant Shri Govind Kishor Goswami.   The following topics were discussed in the meeting &amp; unanimously  resolved:</p>
<p>Vrindavan is the holy abode of the Divine Couple of  Shri Radha and Krishna. Vrindavan itself is a temple and swarup of the  Lord, hence it is adorable. We being the citizens of the town and the  devotee of Shri Krishna have the prime responsibility of maintaining the  sanctity of this holy town and decorate it by planting trees.</p>
<p>Though   Vrindavan is being turned into a concrete jungle, the Alliance will  try to revive its symbolic sacred groves and gardens. The Kishor Van  will be developed as a model sacred grove which will remind visitors and  pilgrims how Vrindavan was in Krishna’s time. The linkages with  Forestry, Horticultural and Agriculture Departments will be set up to  take their technical advice.  Typical trees of Kadamba, Tamal, Peelu,  Piyabansa, Kareel, Paras Peepal will be planted in Kishor Van.</p>
<p>The Alliance intends, for various reasons, to focus more on private rather than public land to develop the greenery.</p></div>

The specific location was chosen as Govindaji Mandir is one of the most  significant heritage sites in the holy city.</p>
<div>Speakers  spoke of the need to protect all of Braj and Vrindavan&#8217;s ancient  monuments&#8211;temples, homes, water tanks, hills and ghats. The Govinda  Mandir was artistically built out of red sandstone according to the  rules of the vastu shastra, and is unequalled anywhere. A program to  assure its continued protection is of utmost importance. All Brajavasis  should determine to see that these cultural treasures are preserved.</div>
<div>Along  with the preservation of these ancient buildings, Vrindavan&#8217;s culture  must also be preserved. Not enough has been done to assure the survival  of these living monuments. Many of these buildings have illegally fallen  into the wrong hands. The government must take steps to see that this  is not allowed to continue.</div>
<div>Present at the  demonstration were: Balkrishna Gautam, Anuj Goswami, Acharya Naresh  Narayan, Swami Pradyumna Pratap Singh, Ram Narayan Brajvasi, Vishnudas,  Ashok Agrawal, Gopal Sharma, Madhumangal Shukla, Prem Chand Saraswati,  Sevak Sharan, Jagannath Poddar, Ravindra Kulasresth, Kailas Dixit,  Shridhar Sharma, Pavan Shukla, Rambabu Sharma and others.</div>

<li>The  trees should not be allowed to be cut when the road is broadened in  Ramanreti. A separate petition should be sent to the Chief Forest  Conservator of Uttar Pradesh, CC’d to Shri Jai Ram Ramesh (Central  Environment Minister).</li>
<li>An integrated master plan should be made soon with the proper participation of local citizens and stake holders.</li>
<li>It  was suggested that the group should talk to the temple managements  where the BVH Alliance meetings are conducted to plant some trees in  Vrindavan to revive the original culture of Vrindavan. If enough places  are not available then at least the Tulsi plant should be planted in  these temples.</li>
<li>A letter addressing to the Chief  Secretary of the Government of Uttar Pradesh were signed by the  delegates opposing governmet’s plan to open the wine shops in Dhaurera  which falls in the expanded Vrindavan.</li>
<li>The tourism  officer should be invited in one of the meetings to understand how the  tourism department wishes to develop Vrindavan and the Braj region as a  whole.

<li>A  Right to Information was signed by Acharya Naresh Narayan to be sent  the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India seeking  information on the current repairs of the Heritage temple of Shri Govind  Dev.</li>

<p><span>Co–chair</span>: Shri Dina Bandhu Das</p>
<p>The following topics were discussed in the meeting &amp; unanimously resolved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vrindavan  should not be developed as a metropolitan city like Mumbai or Delhi.  The small lanes, old tress, ancient buildings with its architectural  value are the charm of this town. There is no sense of broadening the  road by 70 – 80 feet when there is no proper parking available in the  town.</li>
<li>The participation of the priests from the different temples will strengthen the alliance. More temples should join the alliance.</li>
<li>The  trees in the Raman Reti Road and in the Parikrama Marg should not be  cut when the roads are broadened.  The vehicles should be completely  banned in the Parikrama Marg.</li>
<li>The vehicles coming to  Vrindavan should be parked out side the town. The visitors should go to  the temples on foot, using the cycle rickshaw, or the traditional horse  cart. Separate pass should be issued to the residents to bring the  vehicles in the town.</li>
<li>A special workshop should be conducted after 16th April to make the integrated master plan for Vrindavan.</li>
<li>The next meeting on 11th April 2010 will be held at Shri Gokulananda Temple.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Residents of Vrindavan and Braj Mandal</li>
<li>Yatris who love Vrindavan Dham</li>
<li>Goswamis of the important Temples of Vrindavan</li>
<li>Public Administrators</li>
<li>Brahmins and Tirtha Gurus</li>
<li>Members of the business community of the Dham</li>
<li>Leaders of all Hindu-related organizations and especially those with centers in Braj Mandal</li>
<li>Friends and believers of the Sanatan Dharm</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subject: Reasons why all of us must join together now to stop the attack on Vrindavan Dham!</strong></p>
<p>Vrindavan  is under attack. This is an ongoing attack and one may find evidence of  it in every part of town: sewage treatment is inadequate; traffic is a  congested chaos; safe drinking water is scarce; the ghats are in ruins  and encroached by garbage. These are only a few of the most striking  examples causing danger to the residents, yatris, plants and animals and  reputation of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>In this letter, we hope to explain that  the reason that this threat exists is that current plans for the Dham  are insufficient and must include a greater degree of research and  expertise. We will also speak out against three lies regarding this  attack that have thus far kept Vrindavan from getting the care it  deserves.</p>
<p><span>Lie Number One</span>:  Destruction of the environment and historic buildings is necessary if  Vrindavan wants to grow and have modern amenities. One must choose  between destructive development and economic growth or conservation and  economic backwardness.</p>
<p><span>Lie Number Two</span>:  Those who care about Vrindavan are powerless against the destructive  forces of poorly planned development. One must wait for a special person  or organization to save Vrindavan.</p>
<p><span>Lie Number Three</span>:  Those who want to save Vrindavan may do so by acting in their own  communities only and differences among groups make a joint effort is too  difficult.</p>
<p>First of all, there are no adequate plans for our  problems listed above. The Mathura Vrindavan Development Authority sells  flats but has no plans which seem to have the slightest hope that they  may work for our ghats, traffic, black waters etc. Plans which do exist,  such as that for the flyover in Keshi Ghat, which pushes the Yamuna  back from Vrindavan with 23 two meter diameter pillars and traps sewage  dumped in the river to create a poison lake in front of the Ghats, have  been hurriedly made without assessing consequences for the people,  animals, plants and cultural integrity of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>This  negligence is the root cause of nearly all of the town’s problems, and  thus the attack on Vrindavan is being made by all of those who are too  careless, greedy or lazy to think of a proper plan for Vrindavan’s  future. This includes every one of us who does not take part in efforts  to influence the MVDA and other government development planners.</p>
<p>So why is this happening when <span>Vrindavan  is a medieval town of unequalled architectural beauty and filled with  sacred sanctuaries mentioned in the Vedas and Puranas</span>? It has a  wonderful historic past and a living spiritual tradition that is a  treasure for the entire world. These special qualities of Vrindavan are  known as heritage and many people from India and all around the globe  want to protect it so that they may experience and learn from  Vrindavan’s history and culture.</p>
<p>It is happening because people  believe in the first lie outlined above. However, it is NOT true that  destruction of the environment and historic buildings is necessary if  Vrindavan wants to grow and have modern amenities. One does NOT have to  choose between destructive development and economic growth or  conservation and economic backwardness.</p>
<p>The international agency  UNESCO, famous for its ability to help places like Vrindavan achieve  economic development while also keeping its environment and heritage  intact, is interested in working with local authorities in Vrindavan to  make sensible plans for its future. UNESCO is also interested in giving  Vrindavan special recognition among the world’s cultural centers. This  recognition is called World Heritage Status, and it would help protect  Vrindavan as it simultaneously grows and receives more pilgrims and  visitors.</p>
<p>Sensible planning must be undertaken if Vrindavan is to  obtain such high-level help and recognition. The current plan for the  flyover in the Yamuna in front of Keshi Ghat will ruin Vrindavan’s  chances for special status. Why? Because it irreparably damages the  heritage of the town by ruining the beauty of the Keshi Ghat area and  contributing to pollution and illness for Yamuna, yatris and citizens.</p>
<p>With  or without the added fame and pride associated with international  recognition, we must realize that there are ways for Vrindavan to enjoy  the benefits of economic growth and still work to restore and maintain  the natural beauty and historic temples for which it is known. Several  good ideas have already been proposed, including a plan for a Yamuna  channel to return the river to its rightful place in front of the ghats  while a forest on the opposite side of the Yamuna contains hidden  parking lots.</p>
<p><span>This new approach to the Parikrama Marg</span> will protect the walkways in Vrindavan so that yatris may have a safe  and peaceful visit to Vrindavan during which they can envision Lord  Krishna’s lila by looking at the well-tended scenery. We invite you to  participate in creating a vision for Vrindavan and share your ideas as  well. In fact, it is absolutely necessary that you do this. Why? Because  it is not true that those who care about Vrindavan are powerless  against the destructive forces of poorly planned development. In fact:</p>
<p>Those  who care about Vrindavan are the only power that can succeed against  the destructive forces of poorly planned development. People must make  their voices heard. Otherwise, the attack will continue. We will offer  one example illustrating this: instead of investing the time and money  to improve Vrindavan once and for all, the UP government has taken a  different approach.</p>
<p>Knowing that people will not want to visit a  place with problems like those currently plaguing Vrindavan, they have  made a master plan to make picnic malls like Choki Dhani in Jaipur along  the highways between Delhi and Agra. These are in the Vrindavan style  and have names such as Govardhan, Vrindavan, Gokul, and Varsana.  Shopping, business, and visiting exhibits of dioramas of the lilas are  available here, along with full modern amenities and spacious parking  areas.</p>
<p>These shopping areas use the glory of Braj and Vrindavan  to make money while Vrindavan cannot even be given its first official  parking place to tackle the traffic disaster. Is this in the public  interest? Does it give a chance to local Brijbhasis to develop? We will  tell you the answer: it does not. These current plans simply make the  quickest path possible to tourism money by drawing business away from  Braj villages and Vrindavan and do not consider job creation; health;  history; nature, or even Krishna himself beyond his ability to draw  people and money to his Dham.</p>
<p>A better Vrindavan is possible. We  must believe this. The restoration of Brahma Kunda by Braj Foundation  shows that Vrindavan and all of Braj Mandal can be saved. The  administration can be encouraged to enlist the help of professionals and  make a master plan for the revival of the true beautiful medieval town  with modern facilities, including underground electricity cables, proper  sewage and wastewater treatment, and the absence of plastic waste.</p>
<p>However,  this cannot be achieved if everyone acts on his or her own. Those who  want to save Vrindavan cannot do so by acting in their own communities  only and differences among groups must be surmounted. A true alliance of  businesses, institutions and individuals speaking loud and clear and  offering sensible alternatives to the current situation is the only way  to gain the credibility and attention necessary for change. Working  together with local community leaders, religious authorities, local  administration and experts from agencies in Delhi such as INTACH we can  create a better Vrindavan.</p>
<p>We must all participate in a forum based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>actively creating a master plan for improving Vrindavan that respects its people, environment and heritage</li>
<li>participating in nonviolent protest against irresponsible development when necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Let  us clearly set the list of the common interests we all agree on. These  can then be incorporated into a master plan for Vrindavan that shall be  signed by as many important people as we can get behind it.</span></p>
<p>Then we can start doing the job of making that master plan become a reality. If the<br />
plan  we present is not given respectful consideration and the attack on  Vrindavan goes on unabated, we must fight through the courts and make  peaceful protests until our voice is heard. Only then will Vrindavan’s  integrity have a chance of surviving and only then will there be a  chance to allow UNESCO to help us introduce even more people to the  glory of Vrindavan while protecting it and creating jobs for the local  residents.</p>
<p>The importance of maintaining unity cannot be stressed  enough. Those who want the attack on the Dham to continue utilize  bribery and lies to try to create dissention amongst those of us working  to protect it. We must not fall victim to these tactics. We must  remember that our different mandirs, ashrams, shops, and homes are all  victim to the attack on Vrindavan’s beauty, hygiene, air quality, and  noise levels. They are all suffering on several levels from the constant  mistreatment of Yamuna-ji. This is all that matters now. Our  differences have no importance at this crucial moment. Let us make those  responsible for Vrindavan’s development realize that followers of  Sanatan Dharm are ready to undertake any nonviolent action necessary to  save the Dham.</p>
<p>This attack on our town and its holy river has  been allowed to go on for far too long. Please do not delay action any  further. The attack on Vrindavan has to be brought to a halt once and  for all.</p>
<p>Join us at our weekly meetings of the Braj Vrindavan  Alliance to learn more and join in the efforts to stop the attack on  Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Contact any BVHA member or this site for details on future meetings&#8217; times and places.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this. We look forward to working with you to accomplish the goals stated herein.</p>
<p>In the service of Sri Sri Radha Krishna, Brijbhasis and all friends of the Dham,</p>
<p>The Aspiring Servants of Vrindavan.</p>

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Prabhupada Gate &#8211; Three trees have been chopped down on this side of the gate. Middle front is the stump of one of them.</span><br />
<strong>Apr 06, SRI VRNDAVAN DHAMA, INDIA (SUN)</strong> The roadwork is at a standstill in Sri Vrndavan Dham. So far they have  broken down walls and shops to make a start on the widening of the  road. No one knows when they will come with their front end loaders next  and continue with the demolitions.</p>
<p>The street that the  Municipality is widening is named Bhaktivedanta Marg due to our Srila  Prabhupada&#8217;s fame and glory. The spiritual and economic growth of  Vrndavan has been largely influenced by the presence of our ISKCON  Temple here, which has only been made possible by the mercy of Srila  Prabhupada.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/news/04-10/vrindavan10.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="544" height="408" /><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Some of the Neem trees that line the Marg</span></p>
<p>The  street is not only a feeder road for utilitarian purposes, it is also  the most beautiful street in the Vrndavan/Mathura district. The huge  beautiful trees that line its shoulders should not be chopped down at  all and someone must speak for them.</p>
<p>There is also the question  of the status of ‘Prabhupada Gate. It adorns the entrance to the Dhama  and is possibly destined to be demolished, as it too comes into the  parameters of the widening of the road. All the large trees on the  Temple side that used to stand around it have been chopped down. So if  the Municipality keeps to its plans, then Prabhupada Gate will also be  demolished.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/news/04-10/vrindavan11.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="544" height="408" /></p>
<p>If  diplomacy and court action has failed then there needs to be  mobilization of the general devotees to petition the Indian Government  to make an allowance for our Temple. This is not only a local Temple  issue, it behooves the entire ISKCON to take up this cause and make a  stand against this sacrilege.</p>
<p>ISKCON devotees from around the  world need to petition the Temple Management and GBC to make all effort  to make sure that Srila Prabhupada&#8217;s legacy is not disturbed or  destroyed by this roadwork. The road can be made to accommodate not only  the trees, but also our Temple.</p>
<p>This is <strong>happening now</strong> and unless we take action, then something that is precious to our heritage will be lost.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/news/04-10/vrindavan12.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="544" height="408" /></p>
<hr />
<p><span>COMMENT:  You can see from this unidentified devotee&#8217;s concern that he sees the  immediate danger to ISKCON and calls for action from Iskcon devotees.  This is the situation: Everyone in Vrindavan is only concerned when  something affects them and fails to see the big picture.</p>
<p>Keshi  Ghat was &#8220;political&#8221; and so Iskcon put out the word that no one was to  get involved because of threats from the Foreign Registration Office.  But now their wall is getting knocked over and suddenly there is a call  for worldwide mobilization. Where were the laments for lost heritage  coming from the Iskcon leadership when this all began months ago?</p>
<p>The  danger to Vrindavan presented by the Ring Road and the so-called Half  Moon Bridge is far more permanent and damaging to Vrindavan&#8217;s overall  spiritual vocation than this, admittedly misguided, widening of the  road, destruction of trees (one of the few tree-lined streets in  Vrindavan), etc. This road is simply going to funnel more cars into the  Banke Bihari part of town, creating even more jams just a kilometer down  the road.</p>
<p>Where is the brain that can see what is needed for  Vrindavan to be properly developed? Where is the master plan? And why  can&#8217;t everyone get together and push with their combined strength?</span></p>

			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/a-letter-to-the-judge/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>With all respect due to the Honorable Judge of the High Court, I would  like to raise some questions to him and anyone whom may be concerned for  the future of a sacred and clean tirtha with the famous Yamuna Maharani  as its riverfront.</p>
<p>While Yamuna is mentioned in the national  anthem, it is here, in Vrindavan, where her sacredness reaches its  zenith, as Bhagavan Sri Krishna plays his childhood lila on Yamuna&#8217;s  riverbanks.</p>
<p>Below are a few questions that steal away the sleep of my preoccupied soul:</p>
<p>Your Honor,</p>
<p>What  made you think that there is no contamination of Vrindavan&#8217;s  environment, while there is no effective plan to stop dumping black,  contaminated water into the Yamuna, or while the bridge constructors  have stopped the flow of water, thereby creating a huge, filthy sewage  lake in front of the sacred ghats?</p>
<p>What made you think that this  is a bridge that crosses the Yamuna while the only plan PWD has shows 23  huge pillars taking a fly-over motor way from one side of the Yamuna  (Cheer Ghat) back to the same side of the Yamuna and right in front of  the unique and historical landmark known as Keshi Ghat?</p>
<p>What made  you think that this was a well planned project when no model was ever  presented, nor do any lateral views of the bridge exist in the plans,  which would show how the bridge affects the area where all Yatris begin  their Parikrama by taking achman from the filthy pool mentioned above?</p>
<p>What  made you think that the completely contaminated pool of standing water  mentioned above, which is full of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis  elements, poses no threat to the health and well being of the local  population as it seeps into the ground water?</p>
<p>What do you think of the fact that almost all religious leaders are strongly opposed to such as bridge?</p>
<p>What  do you think can be done to save Vrindavan and the Yamuna river? Is it  possible to provide a healthy environment with dirty river water running  so closely to a place that is not only inhabited by people, but is also  world famous and attracts over 80 crores of Hindu Yatris per year?</p>
<p>Is  it possible to have adequate facilities for those Yatris without public  parking and with small roads that are choked with cars and buses for  hours on end?</p>
<p>Is it possible to trust our leaders if there is not  even a master plan in place to tackle these problems in a realistic  manner? Such as in the case of the black water pipes that were  installed, at great expense, but which have proven to be totally  inadequate?</p>
<p>Your Honor, I have many more questions to ask but I  was eager to first present only these few questions to you in order to  learn how to handle the problems we are facing today.</p>
<p>The initial  Stay Order that you granted revealed plenty of concern about many of  the problems mentioned herein. But, now that the restrictions in the  Stay Order have been lifted, how will we be able to advance the public  interest?</p>
<p>In cases where people may prefer a shortcut to reach  the other side of the Parikrama, the proposed Ring Road would most  certainly be welcomed. Another alternative would be a bridge that  actually crosses over the Yamuna at the point where Radha Madan Mohan is  located, and which would connect with parking facilities hidden behind a  nice Braj forest. In this case, the forest road could connect motorists  to the present pontoon bridge. In such scenarios, all parties would be  appeased without spoiling the most beautiful river and riverfront  landmark in North India.</p>
<p>Your Honor, did you know that, according  to our research, there are no other examples, in the entire world, of  such a fly-over bridge in the middle of a river that stops the flow of  water and causes the accumulation of black, polluted water? If the  bridge in question were to be constructed, Vrindavan would become famous  for having the worst conceived public works disaster on a river front  in the world.</p>
<p>Hrishikesh and Haridvara, on the other hand, are  examples we can learn from. They both contain beautiful promenades,  sandstone steps, no dirt, no black water, and happy Yatris everywhere.  What crime have the Yatris to Vrindavan committed to deserve broken and  encroached old ghats, with a Yamuna to be replaced by a filthy pool of  contaminated water?</p>
<p>The road on top of the real ghats is another  problem that has to be addressed. It is common place for cars to hit  Yatris that are walking on the Vrindavan Parikrama path.</p>
<p>I pray  to you dear Judge, Your Honor, to clarify my doubts, and to help us  restore sanity and sanitation to the people of Braj and all the Yatris.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>A humble Yatri who prefers to remain unknown, but who waits for your answer on the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance homepage.</p>

<p>Definitely not a  good news. It is good only to the point that failure brings us closure  to opening up a possibility of correcting it.</p>
<p>I would under no  circumstances doubt the integrity of the Hon Justice at the Allahabad  High Court hearing the petition of one Sri Madhumangal Shukla, hence  fail to imagine that the Hon. Judge acted under &#8216;pressure&#8217; from anyone  or &#8216;siding&#8217; with Sri Shukla. An Hon Justice will side only with the  just. The Alliance is proud to be serving a just cause.</p>
<p>Braj-Vrindavan  Heritage Alliance has its vision clearly focused on the Dham Seva. BVHA  meeting held at Sri Radhagovind Mandir, Vrindavan on the 28th of March  2010 re-iterated and resolved that it should continue to strive for the  following:</p>
<p>1. Vrindavan Dham be declared and listed as a Pilgrimage-Heritage Town by the Central and State Governments.</p>
<p>2. Yamuna be saved from pollution and brought back to flow on the old ghats of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>3.  Due to its its unique Heritage status, Vrindavan civic development  requires a comprehensive-integrated mast plan. The local stake holders  and citizens be involved in the planning process.</p>
<p>4. The Kumbha Mela Sthal be declared a protected area.</p>
<p>I  also take this opportunity to remind the Vrindavan community that BVHA  is regularly meeting and deliberating every Sunday at a new venue. Its  very encouraging to see that each Sunday there are many different  members. More are welcome. Although many are absent, but I believe that  their absence does not betray their non-commitment.</p>
<p>Next meeting of BVHA is at Sri Gopinath Mandir, Vrindavan at 4:30 pm on Sunday 4th April 2010. All are welcome.</p>
<p>Radhe Radhe. Jaya Sri Yamuna, Jaya Sri Dham.</p>

Radhe Radhe!!</p>
<p>Today was the third hearing of Yamuna Bridge in High court. The judge who was looking after our case has given the resignation from this case. He won&#8217;t be looking after our case anymore. Sources say, He was in tremendous pressure from State Government side to leave this case.</p>
<p>This is not a good news at all for us because he was one of the good Judge who was supporting us and was in the favour to save the Heritage of Yamuna Maharani &amp;amp; Shri Brij Vrindavan Dham.</p>
<p>Please do some favour on us, find 2 mins everyday to pray for Yamuna Maharani and for us. We are in desperate need.</p>
<p>Yours in the service of Dham<br />
Chandan Goswami</p>

Perhaps public opinion in Vrindavan is lagging, but if people like Ravi  Shankar,  So&#8217;ham Baba, Dayananda Saraswati, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad  and so many other  significant players on the Indian religious scene  step up, it will not be  without effect.</p>

			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/2010-05-31-braja-news-digest/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>Over on the <a href="http://prema-prayojana.blogspot.com/">Prema Prayojan</a> blogsite, I have been posting articles of interest from the Mathura  editions of Amar Ujala and Dainik Jagaran, as well as other relevant  items when they come up. The intention here, ladies and gentlemen, is to  eventually (soon) have a Braja related news website in both English and  Hindi. When this happens, hopefully the site will quickly evolve and we  will receive submissions from various local institutions telling of  events both before and after they happen.</p>
<div>We also  hope that we will be able to find correspondents who will do some  investigation, interviews, opinion pieces and color and human interest  stories. Obviously, Western devotees are a little more internet savvy  than Indians, even though there are hundreds and hundreds of  Indian-language blogs, which I am also scouring for relevant material.  Such relevant material, up to now, seems primarily related to the  environment, and environmental issues are predominantly related to the  state of the rivers and the ever decreasing water tables.</div>
<div>In today&#8217;s papers, for instance, there are two stories of particular interest.</div>
<div>
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAMORaVophI/AAAAAAAABSQ/2qbJQWCu-Tw/s1600/BangaliGhat.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5477237264103286290" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAMORaVophI/AAAAAAAABSQ/2qbJQWCu-Tw/s200/BangaliGhat.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>One is related to an event yesterday organized by the &#8220;Free the Yamuna from Pollution Movement&#8221; based in the Krishna Janmasthan.</p>
<p>All  the managers and workers of the Janma Sthan gathered and went to the  Yamuna shores where they engaged in a far reaching effort to clean up.  Seeing the enthusiasm of the workers, many of the people there bathing,  whether residents of Mathura or pilgrims from afar, joined in the seva.  The air filled with the sounds of “Yamuna Maiya ki jaya!”</p></div>
<div>
On  completion of the work, Gopeshwar Nath Chaturvedi, a Hindu nationalist  leader, said that their intention is to clean all the Mathura bathing  ghats before Ganga Dassehra on June 21. Apparently, they have been doing  this annually for several years. Since more people are volunteering  this year, they will complete the work as far as Bengali Ghat.</p>
</div>
<div>The  problem is that because of the Gokula Barrage, silt is accumulating in  the river and on the ghats, causing great difficulty to bathers. The  Pollution Control Department took an active role in the cleanup, and  financial assistance also came from the business and industrial sectors.  They engaged 50 workers.</div>
<div>________________________________________</p>
<p>We just posted an article recently about <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/05/saving-water-really-old-fashioned-way.html">Rajendra Singh</a>, who was awarded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Magsaysay_Award">Magsaysay prize</a> for Community Leadership in 2001 for his work in combating  desertification through rainwater capture. Certainly one of the big  concerns that recurs regularly in the Braj news sections is that of  depleted ground water.</div>
<div>
In a plan that sounds similar to  the kinds of things that Singh has done, Whether the work announced by  the a five year plan of dyke construction in the Braj area covering  59,000 hectares at a cost of Rs 68.3 crores. 30% of the work will be  done in the first year.</div>
<div>The program is being run by the <a href="http://www.indg.in/agriculture/rural-employment-schemes/nergs/copy_of_nrega"> Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme</a>.<br />
Since  so much water is being pumped out of the ground for irrigation and  other uses, the water table is constantly descending.  In an attempt to  keep water levels constant, the Soil Conservation Department has  prepared a plan to separate irrigation water from domestic use.  In  Mathura district, the Nauhajhil, Chata, Mathura, Raya, Mant and Baldev  blocks are participating in this scheme.</p>
<p>In the terms of the Soil  Conservation Department, Nauhajhil block was called a “dark block.” In  Baldev the water table is at 300 ft., and other blocks are comparable.</p>
<p>It would appear that the MGREGS is taking active interest in <a href="http://hindi.indiawaterportal.org/node/6465">water restoration</a>.  Dykes will vary in height from according to Ashok Kumar Tewatia,  director of the Soil Conservation Dept., from 1 ½ to 2 feet, and others  will be 2 ½ feet or more.</p>
<p>Higher embankments of 2 meters will  also be built around terrain that is subject to erosion. Survey work has  begun and work will be begun after the next rainy season.  Money is  being allocated for the project.</p></div>
<hr />
<div>
Other than this,  it was a pretty slow news day from the internet sources. The big social  event yesterday in Mathura, which attracted most of the local bigwigs  was a celebration of Hindi Journalism Day at the Press Club. Many people  gave speeches about the importance of journalism.</p>
<p>In human  interest, the two stories that had buzz were the rescue of a 14-year-old  Bengali girl that had been brought by a riksha-wallah from Murshidabad  to be sold for the sum of Rs 20,000. A whistle-blower reported that the  sale of the girl into white-slavery was about to take place and prompt  police intervention put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Another dowry murder was also reported in the Vrindavan area.</p>
<p>No  temple events reported. I suspect that not everything gets into the  online edition. I am hoping that we will be able to interest Goswamis,  Acharyas, Sevayats, Kathavyasas, Pathakas, Kirtaniyas, Lilamandalis and  others to report their events both before and after they take place. We  will eventually post a global calendar including all Vrindavan  sampradayas.</p></div>

<blockquote><p><strong> I constantly sing this hymn to Vrindavan which is most wonderfully  filled with the pastimes of Sri Sri Radha and Krishna, ever surprising  in the expansion of the essence of great sweetness (</strong><em><strong>mahā-mādhurī-sāra-sphāra-camatkṛtiṁ</strong></em><strong>),  the very highest limit of the various rasas enjoyed by the Lord. The  divine land of Vrindavan is unlimited in its good fortune, in that is  the unique place where all the relishable relationships can be  experienced, whose glories cannot be comprehended by Shiva or Shesha or  any of the other gods of this world.</strong> (1.4)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>My  friends! Meditate constantly on Vrindavan with the deepest love!  Rolling in its dust and by offering up your body in this way, become  totally fixed in unshakable love. Worship Radha’s lover, bring  satisfaction to every creature living here, whether moving or unmoving.  This Vrindavan is the supreme destination, so take shelter of it with  your entire being. (1.5)</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>If  the Upanishads do not speak openly of Vrindavan’s glories, then what is  that to me? I don’t care if the dry philosophers who have fallen into  the hole of scriptures do not agree with me about this land. And even if  the devotees who have attained direct realization of the Supreme Person  do not accept Vrindavan, that does not matter to me. Even should [their  words] strike my soul as if with a thousand thunderbolts, it will not  move an inch from Vrindavan. (1.6)</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />O  Bhaktas! Just wrap Prabodhananda&#8217;s language around you like a protective  garment. Slip into it like a comfortable cloak. Listen to him come back  to those familiar turns of phrase and poetic tropes. That nishtha, that  indifference to philosophical debates that deny the reality of his  mystic vision.</p>
<p>That attempt to outdo himself (because there are  no competitors really doing the same thing) in stating what odds he will  overcome without abandoning his goal, his dedication to that supreme  devotion to Radha&#8217;s service in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Let yourself be  carried away, listen to his unique style and language and let him  transport you to the impeccable, glowing, effulgent Vrindavan of his  transcendent vision.</p>
<p>Let his enthusiasm and love for Vrindavan wash over you and wash you away.</p>

Ever since those damned machines came into  vogue, it seems they can&#8217;t restrain themselves from chopping everything  they can find to bits.</p>
<p>The Parikrama Marg through Anyaur, a  strikingly poor village, has always been a dreadful mess, but the idea  that they should build a 66 foot wide road that close to Govardhan is  just so totally misguided it staggers the imagination.</p>
<p>As usual  there was a heavy police presence to enforce the destruction. This time  the local people threw stones at the police and the workers.</p>
<p>I  suppose the next thing will be to build a tunnel through Govardhan&#8211;to  show the miracles of which Indian engineering is capable&#8211;so that the  Delhi day trippers can go from the golf course to Jatipura, so they can  throw a pint of milk on the shrine to Govardhan&#8217;s mouth before hurtling  back to the city.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand it at all. If you must have  heavy traffic going around Govardhan, can&#8217;t you make it far enough away  from the mountain that the natural beauty is preserved or even, God  forbid, enhanced?</p>
<p>As the previous article <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/05/realty-ride-on-divine-living.html">Realty Ride On Divine Living</a> shows, the money is just talking a blue streak here, and there is not though for what the future will bring.</p>
<p>Like  so much of Braj, Govardhan is being turned into a Delhi suburb. I am  left speechless. The madness and destruction is going on so  unintelligently. Who will want to live in Govardhan when it is just  another suburban development?</p>
<p>Again, we have been fast asleep and the forces of the dark side have gotten the jump.</p>

May 29, 2010  |  <a href="http://www.alternet.org/water/147031/saving_water,_the_(really)_old-fashioned_way/">AlterNet</a></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAFFziisQMI/AAAAAAAABR0/8lah5UikTVk/s1600/Rajendra-Singh-200x150.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5476735373607190722" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAFFziisQMI/AAAAAAAABR0/8lah5UikTVk/s320/Rajendra-Singh-200x150.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Rajendra Singh, founder of <a href="http://www.tarunbharatsangh.org/">Tarun Bharat Sangh</a> (TBS, or <a href="http://www.youngindiaassociation.com/">Young India Association</a>),  always wanted to be a farmer. Bowing to family pressure, he studied to  be a doctor of traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine and after school  moved to the Alwyn district in the arid state of Rajasthan. Singh was  not simply practicing medicine, he wanted to test some ideas about  healing ecosystems.</p>
<p>The local Arvari River had dried up during  the 1940s when the surrounding hills were stripped of trees. It flowed  only during the monsoon season. Since that time most people fled local  villages to seek a livelihood elsewhere. When Singh arrived in 1985, he  noticed that only the oldest and poorest people were left in the area.</p>
<p>Drawing  on indigenous Indian knowledge of geology, hydrology and ecology, he  began building tiny dams with johads (reservoirs) on streams flowing to  the river in the hopes of reviving the natural water flow of both  surface and underground water in the region. The local elders chuckled  as they watched him do backbreaking labor with very little results for  two years. Only then, he remembers with a chuckle, did they decide he  was sincere in trying to help them and began offering tips on the right  spots to place dams and johads.</p>
<p>It worked. The water captured in  the johads during monsoon season slowly rejuvenated vegetation, which  helped refill the aquifers (used for local drinking water) and restore  the water retaining capacity of the hillsides.</p>
<p>The Arvari River came back to life and now runs all year as do four other once-dry rivers in the region. <span>Groundwater levels have risen by an estimated 20 feet</span>,  and crucial forest cover, which helps to maintain the water-retaining  capacity of the soil, has increased by 33 percent. People who abandoned  the district are now moving back to farm and start businesses, Singh  says.</p>
<p>In addition, The <a href="http://www.youngindiaassociation.com/">Young India Association</a> challenged plans to privatize and deplete freshwater resources. In the  Alwar area, where Singh began his work, activsts have prevented 40  water-intensive industrial companies (including bottled water and soft  drink makers) from setting up factories. Villagers are creating their  own “river parliaments” to sustain the water commons; each is governed  by two leaders: “one who is responsible to the community, and one who is  responsible solely to the water and nature.</p>
<p>“Water is a very  emotional, spiritual thing,” Singh explains, noting that the once-lost  river is now once again sacred to local people. He says that many of the  older residents now ask that when they die that their ashes be  sprinkled into the Arvari rather than the Ganges.</p>
<p><span>Jay  Walljasper is editor of OnTheCommons.org, a news and culture website  devoted to recognizing the importance of the commons &#8212; those things  that belong to all of us &#8212; in modern life.</span></p>

<p>While  in the Vrindavan mood, since I am already posting Prabodhananda  Saraswati&#8217;s Vṛndāvana-mahimāmṛtam on the Prema Prayojan site in Hindi,  with the translation of Shyama Das (Shyamlal Hakim), I thought I would  try giving an English version over here. This lengthy poem of more than  1700 verses is a celebration of Vrindavan like no other, and often  describes it as almost paradise-like even in the real world of his time.  Certainly reading it creates a desire, an aspiration, to both see the  underlying archetypal reality and to recreate it in the &#8220;real&#8221; world.</p>
<div>As inadequate as it is, in the mood of Sri Saraswatipada, here it begins:</p>
<div>
<hr />
<strong>śrī-śrī-prabodhānanda-sarasvatī-kṛtam</strong></p>
<h3>śrī-vṛndāvana-mahimāmṛtam</h3>
<h2>prathamaṁ śatakam</h2>
<p><span>śrī-rādhā-muralī-manohara-padāmbhojaṁ sadā bhāvayan<br />
śrī-caitanya-mahāprabhoḥ pada-rajaḥsv ātmānam evārpayan |<br />

śrī-vṛndāvana-divya-vaibhavam ahaṁ stotuṁ mudā prārabhe ||1.1||</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Thinking  constantly of the lotus feet of Krishna, who plays his enchanting  flute, offering my soul into the dust of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s  lotus feet, and most respectfully bowing down to the virtuous great  devotees of the Lord, I take up the composition of this hymn in praise  of the transcendental glories of Sri Vrindavan. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span>īśo’pi yasya mahimāmṛta-vāri-rāśeḥ<br />
pāraṁ prayātum analambata tatra ke’nye |<br />
kintv alpam apy aham ati-praṇayād vigāhya<br />
syāṁ dhanya-dhanya iti me samupakramo’yam ||1.2||</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong> The Supreme Lord Himself is not able to cross the ocean of Vrindavan’s  nectarean grandeur, so who else would dare even try? Nevertheless,  overcome by intense love, and thinking that if I dive just a little into  that ocean I will be made most fortunate, I undertake this daunting  task.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span>śrīmad-vṛndāṭavi mama hṛdi sphorayātma-svarūpam<br />
atyāścarya-prakṛti paramānanda-vidyā-rahasyam |<br />
pūrṇa-brahmāmṛtam api hriyā vābhidhātuṁ na neti<br />
brūte yatropaniṣada ihātratyā vārtā kutastyā  ||1.3||</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong> O Vrindavan! Please reveal <span><strong>to my heart <span><strong>your  true essence, your most amazing nature, with all its secrets of  esoteric knowledge leading to supreme bliss. When the Upanishads  themselves are too shy to describe the full manifestation of Brahman,  and so only speak of It in negative terms, then where can we hope to  find proper information about you [other than through your own merciful  revelation]?</strong></span></strong></span></strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />This comment  about the Upanishads is interesting. In the Bhagavat-sandarbha, Srila  Jiva Goswami discusses at length the prayers of the personified  Upanishads from the 87th chapter of Canto X. The question that starts  the chapter is, &#8220;If Brahman is ineffable and beyond the capacity of  words to express, then how can the Vedic texts themselves describe It?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without  going into the details of what is a very lengthy argument, Jiva  concludes that it is possible, since the words that describe the Lord  are a part of His energy and so are given the capacity to indicate Him,  even if the Lord is unlimited and beyond the capacity of the mind of an  individual soul to fully grasp. Jiva also says that even the negative  statements like <em>neti neti</em>, the negative path to the Absolute, is in fact a process of describing the Lord!</div>
<div>Of  course, the real point is that the personal form of God, his name, his  abode, his pastimes all exist specifically in order to be accessible to  the individual souls. They would have no purpose, indeed God Himself  would have no purpose, if there was no one to relish his blissful  existence in all its infinite manifestations and with its divine center  in Vrindavan, the abode of love as embodied in the form of Radha and  Krishna.</p>
<p>Anyway, here Prabodhananda ascribes the Upanishads&#8217; silence about the glories of Vrindavan and Radha-Krishna&#8217;s lila to shyness (<span><em>hriyā</em></span>).  In a later verse, he says that they all became cows in Vrindavan so  they could relish the grasses here. Like the Bhagavatam says that the  great sages all became birds.</p>

<p>Uttar  Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Saturday asked her officials to  ensure the timely implementation of all projects related to basic  amenities in major pilgrimage tourism destinations like Varanasi,  Mathura and Vrindavan.</p>
<p>“Good arrangements of water, electricity,  transport and roads should be made to ensure that pilgrims, tourists  and residents of these cities do not face any problems.” said Mayawati.</p>
<p>Asserting  that laxity would not be tolerated in the implementation of development  works, she warned the officials concerned of stern action if any  complaint was received.</p>
<p>She also said that a tourism development  scheme for Mathura-Barsana-Vrindavan should be prepared and a detailed  report on the same be submitted to the government.</p>
<p>Expressing  displeasure over the “tardy” pace of projects in Varanasi, Mayawati said  all schemes should be completed on schedule.</p>

<p>Vrindavan (Dainika Jagaran, May 24, 2010) ।  The Chief Minister of UP may well have ordered her officers to finish  the Vrindavan Project on time, but the original timetable was not met.  But now with a new timetable it seems that everything will be finished  on schedule. Lucknow has been a bit late in freeing up the cash needed  for all these projects, and this means that the different agencies  involved in doing the work have had difficulty coordinating their tasks.</p>
<p>For  example, one part of the overall plan includes the construction of a  sewage treatment plant. The water department fixed December of this year  as the date for completion. Land for the plant was designated in Rajpur  Khadar and was to be expropriated, but when they inquired from the  district authorities, the claim was refused.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S_pnSUvkYWI/AAAAAAAABOU/lxeTBCOPyTw/s1600/sewage+pipes+on+parikrama+marg.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5474801861525791074" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S_pnSUvkYWI/AAAAAAAABOU/lxeTBCOPyTw/s400/sewage+pipes+on+parikrama+marg.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span>The  laying of sewage line is proceeding at a snail&#8217;s pace with the result  that the building of the Parikrama Marg is being held up. The Parikrama  Marg is 10 km in length, and it was to have been completed by March 31  of this year. This deadline was later extended to June 2010, but if even  the sewage pipes can be laid by this date it would be a major  achievement. The Public Works Department stated categorically that they  cannot build the road until the sewage lines have been put in.</p>
<p>The  project was initiated two years ago, and the laying of sewage pipe was  to have been finished by December last year, but only five of the ten  kilometers had been completed by that time. The work of laying sewage  pipe has left almost all of Vrindavan&#8217;s roads in a ruinous state.  Complaints are constantly being heard from both pedestrians and drivers  trying to make their way around town.</p>
<div>
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S_pj9r43ujI/AAAAAAAABN8/ZEX5JBgjviE/s1600/sewage_pipes_on_parikrama-marg.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5474798208426687026" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S_pj9r43ujI/AAAAAAAABN8/ZEX5JBgjviE/s400/sewage_pipes_on_parikrama-marg.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
PWD  officers clarified that if the sewer work can be finished by June, then  the roadwork can be completed by October. District Magistrate D.C.  Shukla has ordered the PWD officers to start roadwork as soon as the  sewer pipes are ready.  There is some shortage of funds for completion  of the work, however. The work was to be done in five sections, but  although all applications have been made, not all funds have been  received from the UP Government.</p>
<p>In the beginning 187.41 lakhs  was given for the first stages of the work, but this has not been  approved. Money is required by the ROB for all the projects, including  the completion of the Vrindavan-Chatikara Road, the beautifying (!) of  the Parikrama Marg, the bridge around Keshi Ghat, the building of a 100  foot road on the narrow-gauge railway line from Vrindavan to Mathura.</p>

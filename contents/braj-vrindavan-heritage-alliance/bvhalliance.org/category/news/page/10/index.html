<p>I  have been reading the news from America over the past few weeks. You  may have heard that on April 20, 2010, a British Petroleum rig that was  pumping oil from 1500 meters below the surface exploded. Eleven workers  died in the explosion, but the consequences of the explosion are far  more drastic: every day millions of liters of oil are literally gushing  into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>This has been going on now for nearly  two months now, and despite making efforts, neither the company nor the  American government have found a way to contain the leak. The oil and  dispersants being used to make it sink to the bottom of the sea are  quickly poisoning the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>The most visible  feature&#8211;the oil covered birds and other sea creatures, the beaches  covered in ugly tarlike substances&#8211;are being photographed and  publicized. The ecosystem there will be affected for decades; countless  species of fish, birds and water mammals will be deprived of proper  living space. Some of the most beautiful wildlife preserves in the world  with some of the most beautiful creatures that can be found anywhere  will be placed in serious danger of survival.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TApbRxGj57I/AAAAAAAABZM/e_LLeMGDYzI/s1600/heron+in+oil.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TApbRxGj57I/AAAAAAAABZM/e_LLeMGDYzI/s200/heron+in+oil.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="200" height="143" /></a></div>
<p>The  debate about pumping for oil in the sea, where the consequences of such  environmental disasters are so far reaching, rages on in the United  States, but still all too few people are ready to face the bitter fact  that  their automobile-dominated culture and the resultant dependence on  oil is becoming more and more unsustainable.</p>
<p>Here in India, we  are currently undergoing the hottest summer since records were first  kept. It is not the only place in the world where this heat has reached  new levels of intensity. In America also, this is the hottest year since  people first started measuring temperatures scientifically. In fact, it  is shown that this year, on a global scale nearly every single day has  been the hottest on record.</p>
<p>In Vrindavan, the ground water levels  have been receding for years. Last year was a difficult growing season  for farmers, 30% of crops were ruined due to the lack of rain. But this  year, the waters of the Ganga and Yamuna, which are the source of  irrigation throughout northern India, are insufficient. Recent reports  say that only 50% of the water needed for irrigating the rice paddy  nurseries in the Mathura district  can be supplied. Villagers everywhere  are anxious about water supplies just for their basic needs.</p>
<p>And  the problem is not just cyclical, something that we experience here for  a year or two, and which will then be gone when normal patterns resume.  Normal weather patterns may not resume. The glaciers in the Himalayas  that are at the source of the Ganga and Yamuna and the rivers of Panjab,  are all disappearing year by year. They may be fully gone in another 20  or 30 years. Then these great rivers will be entirely dependent on  annual rainfall for their existence.</p>
<p>Luckily there has been rain  over the past few days which may save this year&#8217;s crops, but global  warming is a reality that needs to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>And what is  the basic cause of this global warming, whose effects are so visibly  being felt more and more? It is primarily our use of fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels are being used everywhere, but nowhere more so than in the  ubiquitous automobile.</p>
<p>Two other news items come to mind. One is that environment minister <a href="http://www.zeenews.com/news625432.html">Jairam Ramesh</a> recently  stated that the chances of a breakthrough in the Cancun conference to  combat climate change is very remote, since the big emitters are not  willing to make firm commitments to reduce their emissions. So why  should the developing countries like India do so? And now, today&#8217;s  papers note that the India federal government is again <a href="http://timesofindia.hotklix.com/Hotklix/link/News/India/Petrol-Price-Rise-June-2010-Rs-3-50-hike-in-Petrol-Diesel">raising the pump price</a> of consumer gasoline.</p>
<p>Now  while all this is going on a global scale &#8212; the costs of the gasoline  culture are become more and more apparent in every way, being felt in  terms of environmental damage and global warming, and costs to the  consumer &#8212; we see that no one is willing to stop the mad rush to  destruction that it all entails.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TApeK3eRHhI/AAAAAAAABZc/N4V6KooDtcE/s1600/20060605_Save+trees.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TApeK3eRHhI/AAAAAAAABZc/N4V6KooDtcE/s320/20060605_Save+trees.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></div>
<p>Here,  on a much smaller scale, we are worrying about the trees in Vrindavan.  But this is merely a footnote in this human intoxicated madness that has  been engendered by the so-called progress.</p>
<p>Progress to what?  Progress to destruction of the environment. Here in Braj, where we are  suffering already due to environmental degradation, and what is the  government&#8217;s solution? Create more degradation by building more roads  and destroying more trees.</p>
<p>I could say so much about Vrindavan  itself and what it represents, but just try to see this chopping down of  a few hundred trees in this little part of the world, which a few  people still believe is a sacred, holy place, in the context of a global  rush to self destruction.</p>

<p>Chair: Thakur Shri Shyam Sundar Ji Maharaj through His servant Shri Krishna Gopalananda Dev Goswami</p>
<p>The following topics were discussed in the meeting &amp; unanimously resolved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minutes of the BVHA delegation meeting with the Divisional Commissioner were presented in the forum.</li>
<li>Urgent  attention on stopping the government to cut the trees of Raman Reti and  Parikrama Marg for sewerage laying and road broadening.</li>
<li>Serious  questions were raised on the new sewerage system. There is no need of  the big storm water drains as they will only be cleaned occasionally.  The traditional small drains are better as they are cleaned once in a  week if not regularly.</li>
<li>If necessary the design of the road  and sewerage be changed, but under no circumstances the trees should be  allowed to cut. One way traffic system should be regulated in the  congested areas.</li>
<li>It was decided to send immediate petitions  on protecting the trees of Vrindavan to the President of India, Prime  Minister,  Environment Minister, Hon’ble Chief Justices of both the  Supreme Court and High Court, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh etc.</li>
<li>A  demonstration to be done on World Environment Day, 5th June 2010 to  save the trees of Vrindavan. Raksha Sutra will be tied on each of the  trees which are prone to be cut.</li>
<li>Public Interest Litigation  will be filed in the High Court of Allahabad to stop the cutting of  trees for road broadening, declaring the Yamuna Bank of Vrindavan as  protected area and Vrindavan as Tirtha Sthali, controlling monkey  population which has become danger for human kind.</li>
<li>The website of the BVHA has to be managed from Vrindavan.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
We  are all more or less aware of the destruction and insanity that it  currently taking place in Brindavan in the name of “development.”  Instead of trying to maintain the spiritual and cultural heritage which  is the real wealth of India,  the current government is instead simply   interested  in quick money by  exploiting  India’s sacred areas and  resources in their rush to fatten their purses and attain  first-world  status which they  will never achieve by such careless and destructive  behavior.</p>
<p>Jagat Ji informed me yesterday that on the 29th of May  bulldozers were sent to Anyour, which is a small village  about four   kilometres south of the town of Govardhan on the parikrama marg and  asked if I could get some photos. Grateful for the opportunity to do  some seva I packed my camera, jumped on my bicycle, and wondered what I  was going to encounter. Before actually arriving in Anyour I saw some  buildings destroyed. I was a little confused because what they tore down  with the bulldozers didn’t seem to follow any pattern. It looked random  to me…as if they just picked and chose whatever they felt like  destroying as they went.</p>
<p>The Government wants to install stone  walkways on both sides of the marg and from what I have gathered,   anything within 21 meters of the center of the road will be cleared out  so the road can be widened and the stone pathways can be installed. It  appears that soon you will no longer be able to walk on the natural  surface of the sandy ground when doing parikrama. Let’s all hope and  pray that they leave the inner margs untouched.</p>
<p>So far the damage  from the bulldozers is somewhat minimal, but that is soon about to  change. There are literally hundreds of trees that have  the  red and  white stripes painted on them which I was told by some managers of Brij  Vasundhara luxury cottages means that they are to be cut down. I spoke  with one man and his son who lost their entire house which included a  puja room for a large Govardhan sila they worshiped. The  walls and  ceiling of the puja room were smashed and collapsing. Giriraj was  covered in dust and surrounded by broken chips of bricks and cement. The  man was squatting on a little section of the roof of his house that was  still standing with his chin in his hands contemplating what he should  do.  I saw several Shiva-linga shrines, a mandir of Durga Ma, and many  other sacred places that will soon be crushed by the bulldozers.</p>
<p>Yesterday  they began pouring concrete on parikrama marg from the road leading to  the south side of Manasi Ganga heading towards town. The road that runs  along with the parikrama marg will all be widened and covered with  concrete and both sides of the marg will have those three-sided  interlocking stones covering the natural dirt pathways we all so much  enjoyed traversing.  Nearly the entire road from Govardhan to Radhakund  has been chopped up in preparation for the concrete that will eventually  (probably soon)   be  poured and like everywhere else I saw, they are  preparing for the stone walking paths to be laid.</p>
<p>I will post  some photos that will give an idea what is happening on the parikrama   marg  now from beyond the town of Govardhan up to the area of Govinda  Kunda. I hope to return tomorrow when the bulldozers are scheduled to  come back and take more photos.</p>

<p>In Gaura Nagara Colony, in Tarawali Gali  behind the Chari Sampradaya Ashram, the sewer line digging work on the  Parikrama Marg has broken a watermain, and the leaking water has seeped  into the ground under the houses, causing flooding, movement of  foundations and cracking of walls. Beside this, the waterfill trench dug  by the sewage pipe laying work has kept some people unable to leave  their homes. Municipality EO S.K. Sharma came to inspect the damage but  threw the ball back into the Water Dept’s court, saying it was their  responsibility.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Chattikara Road is going to  be one-way from the Raman Reti Police Chowki up to the Hari Nikunj  intersection. At first the encroachments were blamed for the slowness of  the sewage work, but now in most places along the road, these  encroachments were removed more than a month ago, and still there has  been no speedup. When Commissioner Bobade came, he was told that the  traffic jams were now the principal reason for delay. The Commissioner  approved the plan to make this section one-way and the SSP B.D. Paulson  is engaging more police officers in the area to enforce the rule.</p>
<h3>Old age home being built in Moti Jhil</h3>
<p>On  June 3, the International Banke Bihari Sevak Sanghatan will have a  religious ritual consecrating the ground and a cornerstone laying  ceremony for a hostel for the aged, named after Haridas Bihari. Details  were discussed by organizers on the grounds of the Haridas temple in the  Moti Jhil area on Tuesday. The president of the meeting, Lalita Vallabh  Goswami said that the home would give an opportunity for elderly people  who wanted to engage in the devotional life. Coordinator Prahlad  Vallabha Goswami said the hostel is being built near the Sukhada Bhakti  Ashram. The ceremony will take place at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Yamuna</h3>
<p>One  of the reasons that the Yamuna Action Plan is failing is that when  nodal officers come and make recommendations, no action is taken. Last  month the nodal officer came and inspected the drains, the Yamuna and  pumping stations. At one pumping station, two of the six pumps were  found to be broken.  Silt was blocking the flow in the drains. At the  Bengali Ghat pumping station, three of four were inoperative and silt  was blocking the channels. Because of it, neither station was able to  properly clean the dirty waters. One month later, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Effluent  Treatment Plant (ETP) and Chemical Treatment Plant (CTP) are not being  properly monitored and so many chemicals are entering the Yamuna. Most  of the points raised by the officer have not been acted on. In  particular the <a href="http://www.mapsofindia.com/mathura/industries/">silver polishing industry</a> is a growing source of chemical pollution (cyanide and chromium). Other  chemical polluters are the cloth and metal industries. Recommendations  have been made to move these centers away from the river area, but  nothing has yet come of it.</p>
<p>In Vrindavan, Mohanananda Lal Baba  is back in the papers promising to start agitation for the purification  of the Yamuna, beginning on June 5 for an indefinite time. His principal  complaint is the way the government and NGOs are doing its work. Day by  day, the river is becoming more and more polluted. He will take his  movement to various spots along the river and also to Delhi and Lucknow.</p>
<h3>Heat wave</h3>
<p>After  a short respite, the mercury is climbing again. The average high  temperature throughout the district on Tuesday was 44.9C. The Mathura  area was hottest at 45.7C. The last few days saw some light showers.</p>
<p>Irrigation  officers say that due to the heat wave less water is available and they  are not able to fill reservoirs as planned. The shortages begin from  Meerut. As a result the canals have not been able to supply the  secondary channels. The rice nurseries along the Agra Canal and the Mat  branch canal have not got enough water for their needs. The head portion  are able to get by, but the tail section will be left thirsting.</p>
<p>This  is the usual time for planting rice seedlings, but the water problem is  serious. The requirements in the Dehra head are for 2000 cusecs, but on  Tuesday, only 750 could be granted. Dividing the water between the  various sections has become a headache. Water needed for the irrigation  has been sent to Hathras, for Mathura drinking water and Agra area  farmers.</p>
<h3>Satellite imaging to stop forest fires</h3>
<div>Satellite  imaging is being used to give timely inform of fire outbreaks in  Mathura. The program was started by the Forest Survey of India,  headquartered in Dehradoon, to detect forest fires to within a single  square meter. Its success has led to use in other areas. This new  program started only on May 15, but already 8 fires have been detected  in the Mathura district.</div>
<h3>Haryana&#8217;s governor does car parikrama of Govardhan</h3>
<div>Haryana’s  governor Jagannath Pahadia came to visit Govardhan, did a parikrama  sitting in his car with his family. Stopped at the Danghati temple to  offer milk to Govardhan before heading off to Delhi. He was greeted here  and there by local Congress Party leaders.</div>

<blockquote><p><strong>In  Vrindavan, the waters flowing from the springs are pure and very sweet  tasting and one can drink them to one’s heart’s content; one can eat all  one desires of the delicious dry leaves that fall from each and every  tree. One can take up residence in the spotless caves of the mountains  where cool winds freely blow. When Vrindavan is like this, if I should  ever wish to leave it, it will be a sign of greatest misfortune. (1.16)</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />It  is hard not to read this last verse without being provoked into deep  reflection about the changing times. It is clear that Prabodhananda is  an extremely renounced sadhu. Again and again he expresses a pleasure in  the life of renunciation and austerity. Living in caves? dry leaves?  Not so appealing to us today. But the evocation of plentiful sweet water  gives pause. Even so, the idea of a forested area, with plenty of open  space, easy access to water, is not only a sign of a place suitable for  the renunciate, but for any kind of living.</p>
<p>Of all the Gaudiya  Vaishnavas, it is Narottam Das who has the most similarities to  Prabodhananda. Narottam&#8217;s songs about rolling in the Vrindavan dust,  bathing in the Yamuna, sleeping under the trees, drinking the Vrindavan  waters&#8230; all these things seem to be directly following in the ascetic  mood expressed in Prabodhananda&#8217;s <em>Vṛndāvana-Mahimāmṛtam</em>. We hear  of the same thing in the Goswamis&#8217; practice, but the expression found in  so many of Prabodhananda&#8217;s verses is closest to that found in Narottam.</p>
<p>Like Narottam, Prabodhananda switches back and forth from <em>s</em><span><em>ā</em></span><em>dhaka</em> consciousness to <em>sphürtis</em> of the <em>nitya-lila</em> with  ease, blending the two so that they become one. The distinctions  between that world and this one are blurred until they become  meaningless.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/30/india-heatwave-deaths">The Guardian (May 30, 2010) Jason Burke</a></p>
<p>Record  temperatures in northern India have claimed hundreds of lives in what  is believed to be the hottest summer in the country since records began  in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>The death toll is expected to rise with  experts forecasting temperatures approaching 50C (122F) in coming weeks.  More than 100 people are reported to have died in the state of Gujarat  where the mercury topped at 48.5C last week. At least 90 died in  Maharashtra, 35 in Rajasthan and 34 in Bihar.</p>
<p>Hospitals in  Gujarat have been receiving around 300 people a day suffering from food  poisoning and heat stroke, ministers said. Officials admit the figures  are only a fraction of the total as most of the casualties are found in  remote rural villages.</p>
<p>Wildlife and livestock has also suffered  with voluntary organisations in Gujarat reporting the deaths of bats and  crows and dozens of peacocks reported dead at a forest reserve in Uttar  Pradesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the heat, lakes and other water bodies have  been reduced to parched land, making dehydration common in such birds,&#8221;  said Neeraj Srivastava, a wildlife campaigner.</p>
<p>Even India&#8217;s  northern hill stations – historically a refuge from the heat – have not  escaped. Temperatures in Shimla, recorded a peak temperature of 32.4  Celsius, eight degrees hotter than the seasonal average.</p>
<p>After a  drought last year, India&#8217;s farmers are now impatient for the arrival of  the monsoon, which irrigates 60% of India&#8217;s fields. National  meteorologists have forecast &#8220;normal&#8221; rains for this year, a relief in a  country where prices of basic foodstuffs have rocketed in recent months  due to growing shortages and structural problems with agriculture.</p>
<p>Forecasters  have predicted that the south-west monsoon could arrive over the  southern state of Kerala as early as today, but it is unlikely to reach  the parched north before the end of June.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too long to wait. We&#8217;ll all go mad before,&#8221; said Sanjoy Kumar, who sells dumplings from a stall in south Delhi.</p>
<p>The  capital has sweltered under intense heat for weeks though, having  endured temperatures of around 45C last week, dust storms and scattered  rain brought some relief over the weekend. The new air-conditioned metro  has seen record numbers of passengers as travellers abandon buses,  taxis and auto rickshaws.</p>
<p>Parts of the city have suffered  prolonged electricity blackouts and, in outlying suburbs, water  shortages. In upmarket Mehrauli village, residents were forced to buy  from private suppliers plying door to door with tankers. In the new town  of Gurgaon, entire apartment blocks have run short. In the city of  Nagpur, Maharashtra, petrol pumps ran dry after railway wagons which  normally carry fuel were switched to supply water.</p>
<p>The Indian  Meterological Department attributes the record heat to lack of  atmospheric humidity, hot dry winds blowing across the south-western  Thar desert and the effects of last year&#8217;s El Nino cycle.</p>
<p>Mean temperatures for both March and April were the highest in more than 100 years.</p>
<p>Columnists  have wondered why, given that scorching temperatures in India are  inevitable, the heat has become the centre of every conversation. For  Jug Suraiya, a well-known writer, the answer lies in the concept of  karma and rebirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we moan and bitch and bellyache,&#8221;  Suraiya explained in The Times of India newspaper. &#8220;Because by doing so  we hope in our next incarnation, life will, in all senses of the term,  be cool.&#8221;</p>

Work on the Iskcon Road has to be finished by the  end of June. Random checking will be done for quality assurance.  Insufficiency of funding will not leave any aspect of the work hanging.  There will be no discrimination in the removal of encroachments. </em></p>
<p>Divisional  Commissioner S.M. Bobade came not only to do an on-the-spot inspection  of the progress being made in the Vrindavan Project, which [Amar Ujala  says] is the Chief Minister’s aspiration for glory], but to give clear  orders to the responsible development officers to hurry it up.</p>
<p>[Uttar Pradesh has three levels of administrative area. The Agra division is comprised of four districts (<em>jela</em> or <em>zilla</em>),  namely Agra, Mathura, Mainpuri and Firozabad. The commissioner is the  highest ranking officer in the division. Districts are headed by the  district magistrate (DM). These are further subdivided into blocks or <em>tahsils</em>, headed by the block development officer (BDO). Vrindavan is a part of the Mathura <em>tahsil</em>.]</p>
<p>In  a pointed meeting, he scolded officers from the water department and  warned them that they had to finish the job in three months or face  suspension. Where there is a question of stay orders, he said, they  should work so quickly that the stay orders do not have time to come  into effect. Where stay orders have come into effect, they should use  all their powers in court to get them vacated. The whole project must be  completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>On this occasion, the  Commissioner met with reporters and spoke about the need to speed up the  work. No irregularities will be tolerated.</p>
<p>At about 8 a.m.  Monday morning, the Commissioner inspected the new needy women’s shelter  in Chaitanya Vihar and the flyover crossing the railway line. He also  visited the new 100-bed hospital that is under construction near Pagal  Baba’s temple, the design of which he criticized. He then came and  inspected the work on the road near Iskcon and expressed displeasure  with the slow pace of work and instructed the engineers to have it  finished by June 30.</p>
<p>Present were the ADM, Sadar Rakesh Malpani,  the assistant director of the MVDA R.K. Singh, secretary Manavendra  Singh, municipality representative Yogesh Dvivedi, PWD  executive-in-charge Santram, the water department’s Lokendra Sharma, the  electricity board’s Jagamohan Lal, and the municipality executive  officer S.K. Sharma.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Commissioner went to the  MVDA boardroom and held a meeting after which he spoke to reporters. He  said that work had sped up over the last ten days. Different stay orders  that had come up in court, problems with chopping down trees in certain  places and the inability to get required funding were some of the  causes of delay. Stay orders were being vigorously fought in court, and  applications for the required funds were being expedited.</p>
<p>The  Commissioner furthermore, he said that separate inspections to assure  quality were being made and random checks would be made on all aspects  of the development work. Action is already being taken against engineers  and executives of the PWD with regard to irregularities in road  construction. Contractors have also been put on notice.</p>
<p>With  regards to complaints that there has been preferential treatment in the  removal of encroachments both in Vrindavan and Govardhan, he said that  all demolition work is following the approved design and no one will be  spared. If there are any exceptions, they will be looked into.</p>
<p>He said that a request has been sent for funds for staff and materials at the new women’s hospital to be released.</p>
<p>All  departments were instructed to apply the plan designs as they were  given. A joint committee to resolve differences between the PWD and the  Water Department has been set up.</p>
<p><strong>The Commissioner gets stuck in Traffic.</strong></p>
<p>Traffic  jams in Vrindavan are nothing new, but on Monday a particular difficult  situation was caused when the Commissioner came there to inspect the  Chief Minister’s dream project. Even he ended up getting stuck in a jam.  After inspecting a few places, he came to the Hari Nikunj crossing to  examine the street widening on Raman Reti Road. The garbage, open  ditches and rubble causing a jam that lasted 20 minutes. After the  traffic had cleared, he inspected the whole construction site on foot.  Local citizens and some of the managers asked him to order one-way  traffic. He said he said that until the roadwork was finished, one-way  traffic should be the rule and the road should be closed to lorries.</p>

<hr />
Here, Prabodhananda Saraswatipada  shows his predilection for the doctrines of the Radhavallabhi  Sampradaya, of which he must be considered a founding member. Some of  the differences with other rasika sampradayas are discussed <a href="http://jagadanandadas.blogspot.com/2007/12/sakhi-bhava-vs-gopi-bhava.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Where the dhama is concerned, those who call themselves followers of the <span style="font-style: italic;">sakhī-bh<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;"><em>ā</em></span>va</span> make a distinction between Vrindavan, Vraja and the Kunja, as is  clearly stated in these verses. The development is given beginning with  the standard Upanishad (Mandukya) hierarchy of four stages of  consciousness culminating in the <em>turīya</em> state sought for by the  Advaitavadins, i.e. Brahman. Higher than that is Vaikuntha, and the  various dhams of Krishna lila&#8211;Dvaraka, Mathura, and Vrindavan.</p>
<p>However, Prabodhananda makes a further distinction between Vrindavan, where Krishna’s parents and <em>vātsalya-rasa</em> are dominant, and Vraja, where Krishna engages in his pastimes with the  other cowherds and the cows. Where those pastimes are present, Radha  and Krishna’s most intimate lilas cannot take place. Therefore those  following the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">sakhī-bh<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;"><em>ā</em></span>va</span> have conceived of an abode of the Lord that is exclusively dedicated to the <em>madhura-līl</em><em>ā</em>. This is usually called the Kunja.</p>
<p>Since the Kunja is only possible where Radha and Krishna are present, and where Radha has no competitors, the <span style="font-style: italic;">sakhī-bhāva</span> sampradāyas even consider <em>līl</em><em>ās</em> like the Rāsa to be a part of the Vraja and not the Kunja.</p>
<p>A similar hierarchy can be found in Gaudiya Vaishnavism in the <em>Upadeshamrita</em> (9) of Rupa Goswami, which leads to Radha Kund as the most intimate or most secret portion of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>In the Kunja, Srimati Radharani is most clearly manifest in her <em>svādhīna-bhartṛkā svarūpa</em>. The mood is that of the <span style="font-style: italic;">nitya-vihāra</span>, where Radha and Krishna are never separated for a moment. There is no <span style="font-style: italic;">viraha</span>. Though Prabodhananda as a <em>sādhaka</em> may express <em>viraha</em> from Radha, he never writes of Radha&#8217;s separation from Krishna.</p>

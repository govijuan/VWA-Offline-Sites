<p>A group of 80 marketing students from Girami  MBA  College in Bangalore spent Purushottam month in Govardhan doing a  survey and came up with some interesting finding about the economic  impact of pilgrimage there.</p>
<p>The students not only spread over every inch of the Parikrama Marga, but also did the parikrama themselves at least twice each.</p>
<p>They counted vehicles coming with pilgrims, surveyed all the products that they purchased, like toys, deity clothing,</p>
<ul>
<li>21,544,000 people did parikrama</li>
<li>832,867 in four-wheeled vehicles</li>
<li>285,000 three-wheelers</li>
<li>35,000 in tourist buses (UP and Rajasthan Roadways buses were not counted).</li>
</ul>
<p>Parking income for two wheelers earned 17 million rupees. Over the course of the month,</p>
<ul>
<li>96 million rupees income for guest houses or dharmashalas,</li>
<li>176 million in food business.</li>
<li>4 million by shoe checkers in temples, etc.</li>
<li>19 million rupees were earned by beggars alone!</li>
</ul>
<p>Another  interesting statistic: 50,600 liters of milk were poured on Govardhan  at Jatipura and Danaghati, bringing in more than a million rupees to  milk sellers.</p>
<p><span>At  any rate, it will be a long time before curious tourists from Germany  bring that much money into Govardhan! What is interesting is the number  of pilgrims doing the Govardhan Parikrama in vehicles of some sort. I  would be curious to know how that works. Presumably, they stop at the  various temples and darshan sites like Govinda Kund, Puchari Lota,  Jatipura, Radha Kund, etc. Are these vehicles all sharing the same road  with the millions who are walking?</span></p>

<h3>Mohanananda Lal Baba to start another sitdown strike</h3>
<p>Mohanlal  Baba seems to get in the papers a lot. He is complaining that no one is  serious about cleaning the Yamuna. Last time he went on a hunger strike  the ADM himself came to see him and promised action, but nothing  happened. So he will start again, this time at Shringar Bat. Hope he  does not fall into a new ditch.</p>

<h3>A survey of Bengali widows in Vrindavan and Radha Kund</h3>
<p>The  district government will do a survey of the widows in Vrindavan and  Radhakund in order to follow an order given by the Indian Supreme Court  and Human Rights Commission. has given the order that the way of life of  the Bengali widows in Vrindavan should be investigated. Taking the  order seriously, they have decided to look into the situation at Radha  Kund also, where they are supposedly even more neglected.  In Vrindavan  there are several women’s shelters run by NGOs and the state government  (Mira Sahabhagini), which are absent in Radha Kund.</p>
<p>Volunteer  organizations there do not have a strong income base and are not in a  position to do very much for them.  District officers are aware that  many of these widows beg by the Parikrama Marg, whereas in Vrindavan  they at least seem to have somewhere to stay. There are also a fair  number of widows in Govardhan.  The ADM Avadhesh Tiwari and some other  district officers were in Vrindavan recently to inspect the programs for  widows. The UP government has budgeted for 320 widows to stay at the  Mira Ashram. Mr. Tiwari said that the survey was meant to get a proper  idea of the situation on the ground.</p>

			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/todays-toi-more-about-cars-expressways-and-india/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>Today’s Times of India (TOI) contains several articles related to the  car, so I thought I would just summarize what it says as a footnote to  yesterday’s article.</p>
<p>On a somewhat positive note, in the paper’s  main headline article, no doubt put there because of its potential to  stir up controversy, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy is  reported suggesting <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Reddy-suggests-congestion-tax-to-cure-car-mania/articleshow/6029930.cms">a congestion tax to cure car mania</a> in an effort to turn India’s &#8220;car-crazy upwardly mobile&#8221; classes to  public transport. This pious hope would help reduce congestion and  emissions. The model would be Singapore, “a city much admired by the  same class.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Roads in the country are extremely cruel to  pedestrians. The foot overbridges are so intimidating that people prefer  to jump and cross the roads rather than use them. These are small  things which have to be taken into consideration,&#8221; Reddy said, pointing  out that more than 1 lakh people are killed in road accidents in the  country every year.</p>
<p>Perhaps that voice in the wilderness trying  to promote public transportation in large cities like Delhi, the Indian  Center for Science and the Environment (<a href="http://www.cseindia.org/taxonomy/term/33/menu">CSE</a>),  has been able to catch the minister&#8217;s ear. And it is good that not all  thinking about cars and traffic is blind planning for more roads,  flyovers and expressways.</p>
<p>But the rest of the news indicates  business as usual: First of all, the Society of Indian Automobile  Manufacturers (Siam) announced <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/biz/india-business/May-car-sales-up-30-pc-bikes-26-pc/articleshow/6027239.cms">a new record monthly sales</a> figure for the month of May. The number was 128,851 new cars sold, a  30% increase over the previous high. April figures were close to  150,000. Two-wheeler sales also were in the vicinity of 725,000.</p>
<p>Siam  director Vishnu Mathur said, “Our economy is growing very rapidly. The  per capita income has almost touched $1000 and that is a magical figure,  which is the threshold for automobile demand.”</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TBB6Kf0DJYI/AAAAAAAABc0/V82Wm_EoFUA/s1600/220px-MumbaiPuneExpressway.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TBB6Kf0DJYI/AAAAAAAABc0/V82Wm_EoFUA/s320/220px-MumbaiPuneExpressway.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><span>India&#8217;s first expressway, Mumbai-Poona.</span></div>
<p>This  was accompanied by followups on a central government Ministry of Road  Transport and Highways (MRTH) announcement that a plan has been put in  place to build toll expressways crisscrossing India by the year 2022.  The length of these highways will be in excess of 18,000 km. The roads  will be built with enclosures on both sides to prevent slow-moving  vehicles from entering them.</p>
<p>At present, India has only 200  kilometers of expressway, which is less than 0.2% of the entire national  highway (NH) network. Haryana and UP are currently building three  others: the KMP, Yamuna and Ganga Expressways.</p>
<p>“We are  considering whether a solar lighting system can be extensively used for  illumination. The expressway network must be on a green model,” said a  MRTH official.</p>
<p>The Times Op-ed page also has a semblance of debate, with the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/opinion/edit-page/Highways-to-tomorrows-prosperity/articleshow/6028988.cms">“Times View”</a> saying that highways will lead to “tomorrow’s prosperity,” and the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/opinion/edit-page/Dangerous-and-elitist-plan/articleshow/6028982.cms">counterview by Amrith Lal</a>, who calls the plan “dangerous and elitist.”</p>
<p>The  Times holds up the Chinese model, where 60,000 km of superhighway were  built between 1990 and 2008, stimulating the country&#8217;s tremendous  growth. The columnist also argues that the Chinese model shows that  they:</p>
<ul>
<li>used 40% less land than conventional roads to move goods and people</li>
<li>cut down on vehicular emissions by a third</li>
<li>cut down on accidents, also by a third</li>
</ul>
<p>Overpasses and intersections at appropriate junctions can solve the potential problem of dividing communities.</p>
<p>Amrith  Lal argues that the whims of the elites in a position to pay pricey  tolls are being prioritized over the needs and conveniences of local  populations. He suggest focusing on improving and augmenting the railway  system, which could be upgraded to meet the needs of the growing  economy. It will help more people, move more freight and people than the  highways ever could. Moreover, existing roads would have reduced  congestion if traffic regulations were better at enforcing laws.</p>
<p>It  seems that Amrith Lal is speaking to the wind, as the readers of the  Times of India will not pay much heed to his appeal to improve the  current inadequate transport system. Whatever the long term costs of the  car culture, India is clearly committed to this way of development and  there is not much that will change it.</p>
<p>No amount of appeals to  global warming, the cost of petrol, petitions or people lying across  bulldozer paths and fresh asphalt is going to stop this juggernaut.  In  twenty years perhaps there will be efficient electric vehicles or other  ways to keep such a highway system operative and functional, and  environmentally less destructive. But clearly, no one has an alternative  to this model in their plans to create a modern economy in India.</p>
<p>But  our main concern is with the unique case of Vrindavan and other  pilgrimage towns in India. The point here is not to stop progress or the  advent of motor vehicles. Nor is it a simple question of preserving  local community life, though that is a point of connection.</p>
<p>The  real point is that progress should not mean wholesale destruction of  important heritage towns like Vrindavan. There are hundreds and hundreds  of cities in India where a highway crisscrossing the haphazard  constructions of uncontrolled urban expansion will not have a great  negative effect, but Vrindavan is not merely some urban community like  any other.</p>
<p>Vrindavan is a tirtha. Its function is religious. It  is meant to be an oasis from materialism, not just another chapter in  India’s development story, &#8220;The Long March to Prosperity.&#8221; Vrindavan  absolutely must be developed, but developed in a way that preserves the  value of the temple architecture, the ghats, the Yamuna River, the  kunjas, the trees and greenery, the natural and devotional beauty of its  many holy sites.</p>
<p>More than anything, this development must  proceed in the consciousness of the sacred nature of the town. That  means that economics must take a back seat to preservation and  enhancement of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The local people must be  sensitized to the fact that this heritage, this environment and this  atmosphere is the lifeblood of their economy, and not the hotels, malls  and amusement parks that will be built by carpetbaggers from Delhi and  elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some sanity has to be brought into the development  plans for Vrindavan. Perhaps when this first bit of construction is  finished and the horror starts to become apparent, all those shop  owners, ashram and temple owners and ordinary citizens who thought this  was progress will become sensitized to the blow that Vrindavan has  received as a sacred site of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>As is so often the case, so many will come to loudly close the garage door after the cars have left.</p>

Each day I  collect articles from the online Hindi newspapers to find out what is  going on in the Braj area. These get posted on the <a href="http://prema-prayojana.blogspot.com/">Prema Prayojan</a> blog.</p>
<p>Generally,  I try to post articles that deal with religious news or are connected  directly to temples or religious events, and articles about the  environment or development issues. The weather has been of interest  lately, and I consider that an environmental issue. Occasionally there  are other articles that just catch my eye, but that is the primary  focus. The big problem, of course, is that we have no one contributing  news directly, no intrepid reporters sitting in on Nagar Palika meetings  or following up on the paper thin stories the broadsheets provide.</p>
<p>One  thing I have generally not been posting is reports of petty crime in  the Braj area, though some mentions are inevitable, like today&#8217;s story  of a group of thieves who stole the bells from a temple and were caught.  Dowry or bride murders have been reported in the papers with more  frequency than anyone would desire.</p>
<p>There have been numerous  suicides, many by young women in domestic difficulty, including a  gruesome incident two or three days back where two women put their heads  on the train tracks and were decapitated. But farmers, people losing  their jobs, students who failed their exams, have all committed suicide  in the past few weeks. And then there are the drownings in the Yamuna,  often quite heart-rending, like the bride whose brother drowned at  Vishram Ghat on the day of her wedding.</p>
<p>And then there are the  car accidents. The other day, a woman laborer in Govardhan, working on  rebuilding the walls to an ashram that had been razed in the recent  demolitions, was run over by a tractor on the Parikrama Marg. I  immediately got a frisson of premonition: Perhaps people will come to do  Parikrama as a way of committing holy suicide, like those who used to  throw themselves under the wheels of Lord Jagannath&#8217;s chariot.</p>
<p>There  is an incredible number of road deaths in Mathura district. I have not  been keeping count, but I would estimate an average of two or three are  reported each day. That would make an incredible 700-1000 road deaths  per year in this district, which has an estimated population of two  million.</p>
<p>UP Chief Minister Sushri Mayawati&#8217;s &#8220;Vrindavan Project&#8221;  seems an almost certain recipe for much more of this when the Parikrama  Marg becomes home to ever more speeding vehicles. The roads are intended  to normalize traffic in a transformed world based on the car culture,  but it may take generations before people learn proper road etiquette on  the one hand, and the tractors, camel, buffalo and donkey-driven carts,  bicycles and, yes, people on foot, are taken off them on the other.</p>
<p>Can you import LA to the land of the holy cow? And why would you want to?</p>
<p>Over  the past twenty years, India has seen an incredible growth in the  number of cars and, consequently, in the number of accidents. Last year,  in its first ever Global Status Report on Road Safety, the World Health  Organization (WHO) announced that India has <strong>more traffic fatalities every year than any other country in the world</strong> (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7431714.stm">BBC</a>, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/india/India-leads-world-in-road-deaths-WHO/articleshow/4900415.cms">Times of India</a>).</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TA8RbFhjNNI/AAAAAAAABcU/AVOht_vw0Qo/s1600/66697.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TA8RbFhjNNI/AAAAAAAABcU/AVOht_vw0Qo/s200/66697.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a></div>
<p>In  2006, more than 100,000 people were killed on India’s roads, and an  estimated 2,000,000 were seriously injured. Another 8-9 million minor  injuries. A year later, that figure had increased to a stupendous  114,000 deaths! However, real numbers could be even higher, since many  accidents are not even reported, and many of those injured may die a few  hours or days after the accident. Only in a country where life is so  cheap could such a horrendous slaughter be tolerated.</p>
<p>And India&#8217;s  growing economy means that there has been a surge in demand for new  cars. Since 1991, when economic liberalization was introduced,  automobile production has soared. 100,000 new cars come onto the roads  in India each month, but in fact, cars only make up 10% of the vehicles  on the road. Two-wheelers make up more than 70%, and their drivers  suffer disproportionately in accidents.</p>
<div>The  number of drivers in India is expected to reach 11 in 1,000 this year &#8211;  a doubling since 2000 when 0.5% of Indians had a car. And 10% of homes  now have some kind of two-wheeler. Even so, in absolute numbers, the  proportion of drivers to total population is still very small. India, in  case anyone has forgotten, is a very densely populated country. Cars  and roads take a lot of space in a land that is already very crowded.  How much of such economic development can it take?</div>
<p>Many reasons  are given for the high number of fatalities: one is that people just  don&#8217;t know the rules of the road. Another is the inadequacy of the  roads, which are shared by many slower-moving vehicles. The one cited  most often is speed. The greater the speed, the more chance for  accidents, the more chance for fatalities.</p>
<p>One person, the mother  of a teenage girl, told me of a nice, well-mannered young man who  visited her home in Vrindavan. He had just gotten a two-wheeler and he  confessed, &#8220;Once I start moving, I just want to go as fast as I can! And  woe to anyone who stands in my way!&#8221;</p>
<div>Road  anxiety is so high in India, it is palpable. Traffic jams are so full  of tension as each vehicle competes for every centimeter of available  asphalt. No one dares let anyone pass for fear of being left stranded  and still for an extra few minutes. There is no such thing as fixed  lanes on any road, and two-wheelers take even the narrowest space  between vehicles as an open invitation to attempt passing.</div>
<p>It  used to be somewhat amusing and picturesque to see bearded sadhus  covered in ash and tilak at the wheel of a Maruti or on an Honda Hero.  But the psychology of horsepower of affects even them. They may love  silence in their morning meditations, but behind the wheel, they are  just as likely to honk heavily at any poor pilgrim who encroaches on  their few square meters of roadway.</p>
<p>The point is that roads  themselves, inasmuch as they permit more speed and aggression, because  they habituate drivers to speed in a way that makes them even more  impatient and aggressive when they find themselves in the narrow streets  of a medieval town like Vrindavan, are unlikely to reduce the number of  fatalities. Indeed, they will likely increase them.</p>
<div>Vrindavan was  designed, if it can be called that, for a pedestrian culture. It grew  around saints&#8217; and pilgrims&#8217; desire to walk in the soft holy dust of  Vrindavan parikrama marga, to walk across the sands to the Yamuna to  bathe, to walk from one temple to another in quiet contemplation and  devotion.</div>
<div>The  car promotes the tourist culture of speedy get in-get out. A quick,  mindless fix of see-what-is-there-OK-seen that-done that. An  infrastructure that is based on this mentality may work in an industrial  town, or even some kinds of tourist towns. But in general this is an  incredible destructive approach to development. Even Agra, the main  tourist magnet in North India, is struggling with keeping a balance  between tourism and the natural rhythms of a livable life for the local  people&#8211;what to speak of a town like Vrindavan, whose very product (if  we can call it that) is peace and quiet!</p>
<p>I fear that it is too  late to stop this madness in Vrindavan. By making the pilgrim-choked  Parikrama Marga the main traffic bypass connecting the Delhi-Agra  highway to the new Yamuna Expressway, along with all the other ills that  it will bring&#8211;and they are numerous&#8211;a spike in the number of traffic  fatalities is also inevitable.</p></div>
<div>
And,  of course, those whose pockets are being lined with profits will sing  the glories of economic development and progress and barely pay any lip  service to the thousands who will die, nor recognize that they have  blood on their hands.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TA3A40LW8jI/AAAAAAAABbU/2eyPeKt_PrQ/s1600/chandraswami.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TA3A40LW8jI/AAAAAAAABbU/2eyPeKt_PrQ/s320/chandraswami.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Of some interest is the visit to Vrindavan of the disputed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandraswami">Tantrik Chandra Swami</a>,  who came to national prominence when Narasingha Rao was Prime Minister.  He was known as a &#8220;black magician,&#8221; able to cast spells for the  superstitious politicians who thought he could help them defeat their  enemies and so on. He was the one for whom &#8220;Godman&#8221; became an everyday  word in the Indian press. He eventually became implicated in numerous  court cases, many of which are still pending, but despite losing his  good standing seems nevertheless to have retained some of his &#8220;star  power.&#8221;</p>
<p>At any rate, he came to Vrindavan yesterday and got some coverage in the <em>Amar Ujala</em>. He stayed at the house of Pandit Udayan Sharma at the Tarash Mandir.</p>
<div><a href="http://uddharan.files.wordpress.com//2009/11/mandir-trees.jpg"><img src="http://uddharan.files.wordpress.com//2009/11/mandir-trees.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></div>
<p>Chandra  Swami said that before he came to national prominence, he had spent  time in Vrindavan and received the blessings of Banke Bihariji, in whom  he still has great faith. In fact, he is hoping that Banke Bihari will  help him with his court cases!!</p>
<p>Chandra Swami&#8217;s visit is worth  mentioning in that he also said what more and more people are saying:  that Vrindavan is being turned into a concrete jungle and that something  must be done. &#8220;The state government is pouring millions of rupees into  Vrindavan, but if it destroys the culture, then its religious greatness  is in danger. The money is coming, but there seem to be no proper plans.  A trust must be formed for the protection of Vrindavan heritage,&#8221; he  said.</p>
<p>It is becoming apparent that many outsiders are coming to  Vrindavan and remarking on the atrocious development being foisted on  this sacred town. It is good that the newspapers are reporting these  stories. Nevertheless, it is all too easy for these visitors to come and  go. There is a lot of talk going on, but concerted action by the  residents and Braja stakeholders is very much needed.</p>
<p>The Mayawati Government is cleverly ramming this development project through and we will soon be left with a terrible <em>fait accompli</em>.  And once that is in place, life here will follow the new rhythm that  this infrastructure  creates. Once that new normal is accepted as the  way things have &#8220;always been,&#8221; it will become harder and harder to  return to the kind of atmosphere that is essential for a sane  spirituality. The overlay of <em>rajo-guna</em> and <em>tamo-guna </em>will  become thicker and thicker until the the true, pure spiritual quality of  the Dham will become almost entirely impossible for us conditioned  souls to perceive.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is certainly most welcome that he  got this press coverage, stating what is becoming more and more obvious  to everyone.</p>

<span>Work on the Parikrama Results in a chatri by Shringar Bat collapsing.</span></p>
<p>As  the bulldozers busily work building a large drain along the Parikrama  Marg—signalling the determination of the development authorities to  carry through the road project that includes the so-called half-moon  bridge—the inevitable destruction of heritage buildings is taking place.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a 300-year-old <em>chatri</em> (or <em>burji</em>)  in one of the old ghats in front of Shringar Bat collapsed due to  careless work by a bulldozer operator, resulting in great anger by local  perople. Apparently more than one such chatri was damaged, in both  Shringar Bat and Ranapat Ghat.</p>
<p>Shringar Bat sevayat Anup Goswami  said he had complained to the Archaeological Survey of India and to the  District Magistrate. Millions of rupees are being spent on this  development work, but the contractors are acting carelessly and  destroying the ancient heritage. Despite the complaints, however, work  goes on as mindlessly as ever.</p>

			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/get-acquainted-with-braja-project-started/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>Today&#8217;s <em>Amar Ujala</em> has an article announcing an admirable new project being started under the aegis of the district Community Development Officer.</p>
<p>CDO  Ajaya Shankar Pandeya is engaging block and village level development  workers to collect information and build a database about Braja culture.  Along with their usual tasks, they are now required to also inquire  into local culture, in particular about &#8220;the way it was in the time of  Krishna,&#8221; especially to identify places that have some relation to the  Puranic tales and legends.</p>
<p>The CDO said that the Braja culture  and traditions have spread in every village of Braj. Each has its own  stories and legends that are unknown elsewhere. This research will go  into finding out more information about this heritage and cataloging  forgotten or hidden historical places.</p>
<p>A data base will be built  up that includes details about each village’s hills, water basins,  ancient ruins and sacred places. The appropriate geographical  information about all these places will also be collected.</p>
<p>On  completion, the database will be verified against textual or  archeological data, or by local scholars. This will be followed by the  making of a tourist map and the creation of tourist circuits through the  more developed villages. The last leg of the plan will be to build  roads and so on to facilitate travel to and from these places.</p>
<p>This  last paragraph finally elucidates the mystery behind the development  officer&#8217;s descent into a realm generally left to anthropologists and  cultural historians. Since when do people charged with economic  development engage in this kind of exercise? The answer is that we want  to maximize Braj&#8217;s value as a tourist destination in the short and long  term.</p>
<p>But has there not been a discovery of Braj going on for  the last 500 years or more? Is not practically every place in Braj  already known for its specific Krishna-related value ? And surely there  are numerous books, from <em>Braja-bhakti-vilasa</em> in Sanskrit to Entwistles&#8217;s <em>Braj: Centre of Krishna Pilgrimage</em>,  which catalog the places of Braj. And the Braj Foundation has been  doing a marvelous job of mapping Braj, especially where the kunds and  hills are concerned.</p>
<p>Of course, no one will doubt that more work  of this sort could be done, though it remains to be seen whether block  development officers and village panchayati leaders are the best people  suited for this kind of work. Renaissance men can no doubt be found  everywhere.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it should be noted here that in the world of development, tourism and pilgrimage are two totally different things.</p>
<p>In the June 4 Mathura edition of <em>Amar Ujala</em>,  the Mathura tourist office is quoted as saying that it was having  trouble assessing how many tourists came into the area. One thing was  certain, though: they don&#8217;t count pilgrims as tourists. Pilgrims belong  to a different economic class and are apparently not even worth  counting. One goes to hotels, the other to Dharamshalas or ashrams.</p>
<p>The  reporters who wanted to know the closest estimates for pilgrimage  figures to Braj got no help from the tourist office, which does not keep  such statistics. You see, people who go to see the Taj Mahal or visit  the Mathura museum are tourists. People who come to take darshan of  Banke Bihari or Dwarkadhish are not.</p>
<p>So the wise men and women  who rule India&#8217;s future have determined that Mathura-Vrindavan&#8217;s destiny  is to become a tourist trap. They will parlay Krishna into a tourist  attraction. Well, I am not altogether against it, as long as they keep  the two worlds separate. If they must have a Krishna theme park with a  500 foot tall statue of Krishna surrounded by Kaliya Nag shaped water  slides, let them have it. Let the day-tripping Delhi bourgeoisie and a  certain class of foreign tourist have their Hindu kitsch.</p>
<p><strong>But  let them do it it FAR away from the sacred historical and cultural  sites that have real meaning for the devotee pilgrims of today. </strong></p>
<p>What  a foolishness it is to minimize the economic importance of Indian  pilgrims! The search for the European or American tourist dollar is  perhaps an inevitable aspect of globalization, but it will never be able  to match the economic value provided by India&#8217;s own faithful, to whom  Vrindavan still has profound meaning!</p>
<p>What is needed now is fresh  thinking on this matter. Do you wreck the old Vrindavan, the pilgrims&#8217;s  Vrindavan, to make it accessible to people who at best would only be  motivated to visit it by nothing more than a fleeting curiosity?</p>
<p>Vrindavan  is not a dead archaeological ruin like a ziggurat in Mesopotamia. It is  a living sacred place. And to treat it as nothing more than a tourist  attraction is frankly nothing less than sacrilege. Especially when that  attitude entails a slow process of murdering it, by chopping down trees,  by replacing ashrams with weekend condos, pilgrim walkways with  four-lane highways, and covering the holy river and sacred ghats with  flyovers!</p>
<p>The way to plan tourism for Braj is to develop it AS a  sacred place of pilgrimage. To develop the sacred character of the land.  The current plans being rammed through are so wrongheaded they stagger  the imagination. The sadhus and sants of Braj are left dumbfounded  watching the big heads and suits come here from their Delhi, Agra and  Lucknow offices to stomp all over this land without the slightest  feeling for what makes Vrindavan something of value in the first place.</p>
<p>Vrindavan is not some curiosity to be stared at, or oohed and aahed at. Let&#8217;s work on getting Vrindavan to be <strong>what it was meant to be</strong>,  not what some tourist development officer thinks will attract tourist  dollars. There will be no fear for economic development.</p>
<p><strong>Vrindavan as it was meant to be is the abode of the All-attractive Lord and Lady of Love. </strong> The people who are attracted to Them will attract people from all corners of the globe.</p>
<p>Turn  Vrindavan into a heap of ruins and it will sink into oblivion. It may  be surrounded on all sides by superhighways, but it will just be  something to throw your empty Coke bottle at as you go gawking by on the  overpass.</p>
<p>Even the Taj Mahal only holds a tourist&#8217;s interest  for a few moments. The real Vrindavan&#8217;s attraction is far more powerful  than that. Why are we trading diamonds for grains of sand?</p>

<p>On  June 5th World Environment Day the members of the alliance protested  against the cutting of trees by tying Raksha Sutra on the ancient trees  of Ramanreti and Parikrama Marg.  The BVHA members met at the Bhagwat  Niwas before the demonstration.</p>
<p>The speakers said that the  government had cut hundreds of fully grown trees in Mathura – Vrindavan  road in the name of Development in Vrindavan. Now they are planning to  cut the ancient trees of Raman Reti and Parikrama Marg for road  broadening. If needed the design of the road and sewerage system should  be changed.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAtgijtaQ2I/AAAAAAAABaU/Ad4s-jOMWDo/s1600/DSCN1455.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAtgijtaQ2I/AAAAAAAABaU/Ad4s-jOMWDo/s320/DSCN1455.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The  trees are the soul of Braj – Vrindavan and Krishna lover will oppose  any kind of action which results into tree cutting. The roads are being  broadened for the increasing number of traffic in Vrindavan. But there  is no traffic plan for the town.</p>
<p>Big buses and vehicles are  allowed to park in the middle of the road. If needed, one-way traffic  rules should be enforced for few hours on certain busy streets which  lead to the major temples.</p>
<p>We don’t want Vrindavan to be developed as a metropolitan city. It should be developed as Tirtha sthali.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAtgpBHJVVI/AAAAAAAABas/Xy18XguUcJQ/s1600/DSCN8258.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TAtgpBHJVVI/AAAAAAAABas/Xy18XguUcJQ/s200/DSCN8258.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>As  its name suggests, Vrindavan used to be a jungle, but the land mafias  and so-called developers are working hand in hand to destroy Vrindavan’s  heritage. No government has seriously thought of Vrindavan’s  development since Independence. Now  for the first time a huge amount of  funds is being spent on this development. There is nothing wrong in the  intention of the government. But whatever destruction is happening is  due to the lack of planning.</p>
<p>The government should sit with the  citizens and make a plan how to develop this temple town. The situation  becomes more alarming when the government makes sewage drains (<em>nullahs</em>)  over the ancient ghats on the Yamuna. This legitimizes the illegal  encroachments on the ghats and makes it impossible to bring the Yamuna  back to these original ghats.</p>
<p>The Archaeological Survey of  India, which is the government agency responsible for the protection of  ancient buildings is not taking any interest in protecting these  magnificent ghats. The miniature art of these ghats is better than that  of any other pilgrimage town. The ASI is not even taking proper care of  those monuments that are officially protected by it.</p>
<p>Several  unnecessary drains are also being built in the town. These drains are so  big that they will be only be cleaned occasionally. The traditional  small drains were far better in that municipal workers cleaned them  regularly. It is a big question how the sanctity of this holy town will  be maintained if it is transformed into a fully concrete jungle.</p>

<p>Prabodhananda continues with his description of Vrindavan’s natural beauty:</p>
<p><span>mahā-premāmbhodher yad anupama-sāraṁ yad amalaṁ<br />
hari-premāmbhodheḥ madhura-madhuraṁ dvīpa-valayam |<br />
munīndrāṇāṁ vṛndaiḥ kalita-rasa-vṛndāvanam aho<br />
tad etad dehāntāvadhi samadhivāsaṁ diśatu me ||</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>O  Vrindavan, you who are the spotless incomparable essence of the great  ocean of love, you who are the archipelago of great sweetness in the  ocean of love for Lord Krishna, you in whom the greatest of sages  envisioned the topmost flavors of love, please bestow upon me residence  here until the very end of this life. (1.17)</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr /><span>vāpī-kūpa-taḍāga-koṭibhir aho divyāmṛtābhir yutaṁ<br />

divyāneka-nikuñja-mañjulataraṁ dhyāyāmi vṛndāvanam ||</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I  meditate on Vrindavan, which has divine waters filling its millions of  lakes, wells and reservoirs, with amazing gardens of trees and vines  filled with fruits and flowers, an infinite number of birds and beasts  fill these forest lands with wondrous beauty, with so many divine bowers  and groves beautifying it in every direction. (1.18)</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr /><span>śrī-rādhikā-madana-mohan-keli-kuñja-<br />
puñjair vṛta-druma-latā-ghana-ratna-bhūmi |<br />
ānanda-matta-mṛga-pakṣī-kulākulaṁ śrī-<br />
vṛndāvanaṁ harati kasya haṭhān na cetaḥ ||</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Whose  mind will this beautiful land of Vrindavan not steal away, its jeweled  terrain covered with thick foliage from the trees and vines throughout  the many, many thickets where Radha and Madanamohana play, where the  birds and beasts are intoxicated with joy? (1.19)<br />
</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />I  heard that when the Muslim marauders came eastwards conquering India,  they thought they had reached paradise when they came to Bengal, because  for the first time they reached a place that was really lush and  verdant. The Quranic paradise is described in terms of plentiful water,  flowers and fruit filled trees.</p>
<p>Perhaps Vrindavan never was and  never could be the luxuriant and bounteous place that the Vaishnava  poets described, either after seeing or imagining, but certainly  chopping down trees willy nilly is a recipe for desertification. This is  well known. The only way to stave off making Vrindavan into a barren,  parched wasteland is to preserve and expand its greenery.</p>
<p>An  African proverb says when an old person dies, a library burns to the  ground with him. What is lost when an old tree is chopped down? What  reservoirs of ground water, what wealth of shade for weary walkers in  the hot season? What witness, on the parikrama marga in Vrindavan, of  countless bhaktas singing or muttering Radha and Krishna&#8217;s names?</p>
<p>Grow more trees and don&#8217;t chop the old ones down.</p>

<p>Mathura District  Magistrate D.C. Shukla inspected work on the Govardhan Parikrama Marg  yesterday to see what progress is being made in preparations for the  upcoming Muriya Purnima festival, which takes place on July 25.</p>
<p>In  several places he came across flooding drains and accumulations of  filth, damaged roads, and other problems. He scolded the officers  accompanying him and told them to have a plan ready by July 15 to deal  with them.</p>
<p>The DM first visited Anyaur and saw accumulations of  waste water outside the village due to improper drainage. He instructed  PWD officers to solve the drainage problem and to barricade the swamp  caused by it within two days.</p>
<p>He ordered the road to be smoothed  at Puchari, where there are large pieces of rubble and for all  electricity poles to be removed from the road to the sides.</p>
<p>He chastised the EO of the Govardhan Panchayat for the accumulations of water near the Panchayat offices.</p>
<p>He  also came to take a look at Manasi Ganga where he expressed displeasure  on seeing the dirty water draining into the kund. He chastised the  Waterworks officers and told them to have this problem taken care of by  the 15th of July so that only clean water is filling Manasi Ganga.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by SSP B.D. Paulson, ADME Rakesh Malpani, CO Sadar Kayam Singh and other officers.</p>

After so many difficulties and an expenditure of more than 22  crores of rupees, the tank is being refilled with dirty water. The very  limits of carelessness have been exceeded by allowing dirty water from  the surrounding drains to empty into the tank.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDfKlyso5KI/AAAAAAAABrY/y517sBydT8c/s1600/2010.07.10.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDfKlyso5KI/AAAAAAAABrY/y517sBydT8c/s200/2010.07.10.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a></div>
<p>This  coming full moon is Muriya Purnima, on which day millions of people  come to Govardhan to do parikrama and to bathe in the Manasa Ganga. The  festival commemorates Guru Purnima and the disappearance of Sanatan  Goswami. The expected influx of pilgrims into the area may exceed 10  million. It is the biggest such event of the year in the Govardhan area.</p>
<p>The  government authorities in charge of development were pushing to have  the samskar of the the tank ready by this date, and so they pushed  forward with refilling before the sewage treatment facilities had been  completed.</p>
<p>Work on cleaning and restoring Manasa Ganga has been  going on for nearly a year now. The entire purpose of the effort was to  get rid of the polluted waters by draining the reservoir, excavating the  bed, and then refilling it with clean water. Now it seems that they due  to mismanagement, they are simply reverting to the original situation,  proving that the entire expenditure has been a waste.</p>
<p>A pumping  station was being built on the Radha Kund Road at a cost of several  crores, but it has not been completed. It does not seem that it will be  ready for some time yet, and the machinery to do the water purification  is not yet in place.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDfKtyRDsKI/AAAAAAAABrg/z6nG7_5oJwk/s1600/2010.07.10_manasagangadrain.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDfKtyRDsKI/AAAAAAAABrg/z6nG7_5oJwk/s200/2010.07.10_manasagangadrain.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="200" height="156" /></a></div>
<p>Several  of the ghats that were to be repaired are as yet incomplete. Throughout  this all, a great deal of noise is being made about the Muriya Purnima  preparations. Fearful that the Manasa Ganga would still be empty when  the influx of pilgrims came, it was decided to start filling it now,  even though by any standards it would have been premature.</p>
<p>Water  coming into the reservoir from the Chakleshwar side on Wednesday was  observed to be mixed with filthy mud, causing great concern to everyone.  Local people are saying that they could not imagine that this would be  the end result of a project in which so much money had been invested.  They are asking what was the point of doing all the excavation and  filling up the Manasa Ganga if pilgrims and local people are once again  going to have to bathe in dirty water.</p>
<p>The assistant District Magistrate, Rakesh Malpani, has been informed of the situation and is looking into the matter.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Drownings at Braj&#8217;s ghats</h3>
<p>In  related news, on June 29, Dainik Jagran reported the drowning of a  5-year-old child in the Manasa Ganga. The reason seems to be that she  lost her footing on the steps and slipped into the water. She was there  with friends, but by the time they noticed she had fallen into the water  and people had jumped into the water to pull her out, she had lost her  life.</p>
<p>There are a great number of drowning reported on a nearly  daily basis, whether in the Yamuna or  the various kunds and tanks in  the Braj area. Yesterday also, newspapers reported two drownings in  Kusum Sarovar. The other day, someone also drowned in Radha Kund. This  may be an auspicious way to end one’s life on earth, but authorities  should be taking safety matters into consideration when they plan the  upgrade and improvement of these holy water tanks.</p>
<p>It seems that  with all the work that is being done on restoring kunds in the Braj area  by various government and non-government agencies, some thought might  be put into devising a safety system whereby the sudden steep descent of  steps is reduced, at least in some of the ghats.</p>
<p>Child safety  zones could be created where the water is shallower. At the very least,  chains could be installed as in many bathing places so that older  persons and invalids can bathe with a bit more security.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  Indian children are not given swimming lessons and it seems that they  panic easily in the water. And of course, there are no lifeguards.</p>

<h4>Apocalypse now?</h4>
<p>As  the world&#8217;s population balloons to almost 7 billion, it&#8217;s become more  and more difficult to find anywhere on Earth unaffected by man-made  pollution and development, and far too often it takes things going  really wrong before people take action to keep our planet clean. So  here&#8217;s a list that might help to motivate: The 15 most polluted places  in the world.</p>
<h4>Yamuna River, India</h4>
<p>The Yamuna is the  largest tributary of the Ganges River. Where it flows  through Delhi,  it&#8217;s estimated that 58 percent of the city&#8217;s waste gets dumped  straight  into the river. Millions of Indians still rely on these murky,   sewage-filled waters for washing, waste disposal and drinking water.</p>

<strong>Who will protect the holy sites in the sacred town of Vrindavan, India, where Krishna first appreared? </strong></p>
<p>For  centuries, this 27-square-mile town on the road from Delhi to Agra has  been the holiest of holy places for devotional Hindus. Drums, brass hand  cymbals, and the chanting of ancient prayers echo out each morning from  Vrindavan&#8217;s 5,000 temples.</p>
<p>Yet recent changes such as satellite  television, digital phone service, and real estate development have  brought this medieval site on the banks of the Yamuna River into the  21st century. Not everyone is happy with the transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a  painful subject,&#8221; says Shrivatsa Goswami, whose family traces its roots  to Vrindavan&#8217;s 16th-century restorers. &#8220;In those days, this place had  the most beautiful riverside architecture in India&#8217;s history. It was  like a miniature painting come alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goswami notes that  previous generations of temple authorities understood the importance of  holy places and took responsibility for their maintenance. Today, he  says, that sense of stewardship is absent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many religious  leaders here have a narrow view,&#8221; Goswami says. &#8220;They don&#8217;t see the  universality of their own message. They don&#8217;t see how a sacred site such  as this can inspire people of all faiths. What they see is commercial  opportunities, and the result is garbage and sewage backing up. In a few  more years, my own children will not want to come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beginning  in the 17th century, Moguls and other invading forces razed Vrindavan&#8217;s  temple domes and left the town in architectural ruin. But according to  Goswami, the real damage began with India&#8217;s independence in 1947. Rather  than return to its spiritual roots, the nation became a secular  industrial power. India&#8217;s cultural heritage in general, and holy places  in particular, suffered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are only two hours from Delhi,&#8221;  says Goswami, &#8220;and people are feverishly spending millions to turn  Vrindavan into a suburb. Because there is so little appreciation for  holy places, developers get away with using the Yamuna as a dump for  their construction. Instead of dredging to restore the river&#8217;s natural  beauty, they have laid a tar road along its banks and in the riverbed to  facilitate more traffic. I refuse to walk on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indic  scriptures identify Vrindavan as the place where Krishna, the Sanskrit  name for God in personal form, appeared 5,000 years ago. Followers  consider Vrindavan as having its genesis in the spiritual world.  Devotees consequently worshipped the town as fervently as Krishna  himself.</p>
<p>Yet with modernization, the nature of pilgrimage to  this holy spot has shifted dramatically. As recently as the 1980s,  hardly one car a day arrived here, and there was little to distract from  an all-day walking tour of medieval sites. Today, traffic backs up  along the newly completed six-lane National Highway. A water park has  opened less than seven miles from Govardhan, a hill that is among  Vrindavan&#8217;s most sacred spots. Near the actual site of Krishna&#8217;s  appearance in nearby Mathura, Pepsi-Cola has constructed a production  plant. Cell phone towers loom up into the sky over temple domes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There  is a risk of the spiritual experience becoming diluted,&#8221; says Braja  Bihari, an American scholar who has lived in Vrindavan for 27 years.  &#8220;Previously, you never saw people playing boomboxes or contaminating the  roads with plastic bags. They came here to get away from those  influences. The deep, contemplative experience is still available, but  you have to work a little harder to find it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some  environmental organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature are  working to restore Vrindavan through programs of reforestation. Ranchor  Prime, the project&#8217;s India liaison, notes that ecological values have  always played an important role in Hinduism but have suffered in the  rush of modernization.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the faith leaders brought back their  own tradition of cleanliness and respect for nature here, in one of the  greatest holy places of India,&#8221; says Prime, &#8220;it could have a dramatic  impact nationwide. Environmental awareness is not a hollow religious  sentiment. It makes practical sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone sees the  changes in dire terms. Lokanath Swami, a religious leader from South  India, sees an upside to modernization: comfortable facilities attract  clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, people have to want to come to a holy place,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Then the inner experience can occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, he agrees with Goswami&#8217;s assessment that leadership must take an active role in protecting the site&#8217;s integrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The  scriptures tell us that the real pilgrimage is not bathing in a river,&#8221;  he says, &#8220;but taking instruction from the saintly people who make such  places their home. And certainly they have an added degree of  responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historically, holy places have been the refuge  of ascetics seeking escape from the material world. It would take days  or weeks to arrive at a holy place. Once there, pilgrims confronted  austere conditions that quickly separated spiritual dabblers from the  truly devout. Today, the opposite holds true as developers encourage  tourism and Vrindavan struggles to adjust, for the first time in  history, to market economics. Like many other places of pilgrimage in  India, this is a town faced with reconciling its cultural and spiritual  purposes with its need for a stronger economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even  staunch defenders of Vrindavan&#8217;s innate sanctity acknowledge the  inevitability of modernization and accept, as well, its potential value.  From the roof of his art institute, called Sri Caitanya Prema  Samsthana, Goswami can see solar panels on buildings in surrounding  villages. The panels feed energy to satellite dishes that connect  farmers to Hindi-language Internet Web sites, which provide  district-specific weather reports, current market prices and tips on  modern growing methods.</p>
<p>More than half the residents in the  Vrindavan area live off the land, and Goswami acknowledges that the  technology could lead to improved quality of life and possibilities for  saving Vrindavan from urban blight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirituality has never been  an enemy of science and technology,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Devotion and knowledge  have always gone together. That is the Indian approach. I&#8217;m not afraid  of laptops and satellites. It is losing the spiritual content of  Vrindavan that has me concerned. That cannot be stopped by better  technology alone. That can only be stopped if the religious leaders come  out of their shells and renew their emotional bond with their own  culture and history.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
Despite the harsh and  uncomfortable comments made by Joel Stein on the changing landscape of  his hometown Edison, NJ, due to the influx of Indian immigrants, I do  find a strong reasons to empathize with him.</p>
<p>We all possess a  sense of belongingness to our native places &#8211; whether we are Indians,  Americans, Europeans, or Australians. Every culture, tradition and  lifestyle has its own innate strengths as well as its share of  weaknesses. We all like to live in our own peculiar manner and  cherish  our own customs and traditions. It is therefore legitimate for Stein to  duly express  feelings.</p>
<p>Just as Stein is disturbed or concerned  or astonished over the transformation of his American hometown, I too am  concerned and disgusted over a similar transformation of one of the  most venerated spiritual places in India, which has been brought about  by the mindless influx of an insensitive band of American NRIs and the  accompanying flood of dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDVqd3G2Q1I/AAAAAAAABqI/vfyR4nZD9pE/s1600/7_gahvaravanjpg.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDVqd3G2Q1I/AAAAAAAABqI/vfyR4nZD9pE/s400/7_gahvaravanjpg.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>Chiksoli  and Manpur are twin villages near the town of Barsana (located in  District Mathura in the state of Uttar Pradesh), which happens to be the  birthplace of Srimati Radharani, the eternal consort of Sri Krishna,  the propounder of the world famous Srimad Bhagvad Gita.</p>
<p>Everything  was going on well in these twin villages till about a decade ago. The  serene rural settings compounded by the ecological grandeur of  Gahvarvan, one of the finest sacred groves of Braj, Dohini Kund, Vihar  Kund, Maangarh, Vilasgarh, Ashtasakhi hills, Radha Sarovar, Mor Kuti,  Kadamb Khandi and the surrounding expanses of fertile agricultural land,  gave an internalizing experience to one and all who dared to visit  these spiritual hamlets.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDVqmxIURrI/AAAAAAAABqQ/KKL877teZlo/s1600/7_rameshbaba.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDVqmxIURrI/AAAAAAAABqQ/KKL877teZlo/s320/7_rameshbaba.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>The experience was further amplified by the musical renditions of <a href="http://www.brajdhamsewa.org/Babashri.aspx">Sri Ramesh Baba</a>,  the revolutionary saint of Braj, performed in honor of the Divine  Couple Sri Radha Krishna, every evening. The warm hospitality offered by  the local people at Ras Mandir made one forget the comforts of the  finest hospitable destinations.</p>
<p>A community-led movement aimed  at reviving the lost heritage of the region comprising of ancient water  bodies, sacred groves, degraded pasture lands and hill slopes was going  on, silently inspired by Sri Ramesh Baba. It reinstilled the confidence  in the local youth to take charge of their ecological infrastructure and  build upon their prosperous socio-economic enterprises on the innate  strength of Braj.</p>
<p>To attract further support, a team of locals  went to the US to seek the support of the American NRI (non-resident  Indian) community there. This proved to be a &#8216;turning point&#8217; in the  destiny of the twin hamlets of Chiksoli and Manpur, as the Lyndon  Johnson&#8217;s 1965 decision to open America&#8217;s gates to Asian immigrants  resulted in such drastic changes to Stein&#8217;s Edison.</p>
<p>Hordes of Non  Resident Indians were attracted to the charismatic Sri Ramesh Baba and  started, in their own characteristically pompous style, to influence the  entire state of affairs. The simple rural folk were swayed by their  economic might and started selling off their prized lands for the  invaders&#8217; palatial spiritual retreats.</p>
<p>The place&#8217;s austerity and  simplicity took less than a decade to get lost. The way that Edison was  overrun by alien and unadapting South Asians, Chiksoli and Maanpur were  encroached on by materialistic spiritualists.</p>
<p>Now there are  multi-story towers in these small villages with shoddy drainage and  sewerage disposal systems. The ostentatious display of money is clearly  visible everywhere. To house cattle, fortresses have been built as if  they are real endangered species.</p>
<p>Instead of upgrading the local  school Sri Raseshwary Vidya Mandir, which was to be turned into a rural  university, the entire focus has shifted on building residential  apartments for the overseas clients. Due to the lack of building  regulations in these rural areas and the absence of adequate local  government or infrastructure, havoc is being created. Effluent from  these gushing buildings is despoiling the local habitat at a pace that  far exceeds its ability to cope.</p>
<p>Cultural invasions are  happening all across the globe. Whether it is Edison, New Jersey, or  Chiksoli-Manpur near Barsana. In both cases, local communities are at  peril and at a disadvantage as their independence and liberty is  encroached upon.</p>
<p>I would certainly empathize with Stein as I too  feel I have lost the very place that was the source of my inspiration  and instruction while I was a little kid, which is no longer holds the  same charm and attraction for me and I now rarely visit.</p>
<p>Stein  has simply been vocally condemned and publicly chastized by the  Indian-American Community. My own criticism of the NRI invasion in  Barsana has resulted in threats from goons flourishing on their  financial support, so that I have practically speaking been exiled from  there.</p>
<p>Cultural invasions of such insensitivity should not and just cannot be tolerated or patronized.</p>

Dr. K.L.Meena, the District Forest Officer attended the seminar  as the Chief Guest.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDRtkP9_N5I/AAAAAAAABpo/wzXMSBgvmOM/s1600/DSCN1648+c.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDRtkP9_N5I/AAAAAAAABpo/wzXMSBgvmOM/s400/DSCN1648+c.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></div>
<p>Dr.  Meena said that the seminar was organized in a place where the glimpse  of original swaroop of Vrindavan can be seen. He said the venue, weather  and the flora fauna perfectly matched the cause of organizing the  seminar. The peacock dancing, parrots and other birds tweeting reminded  him of the actual duty of the Forestry Department.</p>
<p>The seminar  formally began with reading the message sent by His Holiness Acharya  Shrivatsa Goswami who is currently traveling on a spiritual tour in  Europe.</p>
<p>The speakers said that Vrindavan should be declared a  pilgrimage town as well as an Environment Sensitive Zone. Though it has  already been transformed into a concrete jungle, there is still hope  that some certain areas can be made completely green.</p>
<p>It was  stressed that whatever injury is caused to the swaroop and environment  of Vrindavan by cutting down trees is unforgettable and unforgivable,  and can only be remedied if the Forestry Department plants ten times  more trees in and around Vrindavan. The Department should frequently  organize Van Mahotsavas.</p>
<p>It was decided that a committee should  be formed which will suggest where trees can be planted under the  public-private partnership (PPP) model. The speakers said that the  Forestry Department should try to acquire the whole Yamuna Khadar  (front) area and do massive plantation there.</p>
<p>It was also  decided that the Honorable High Court which is hearing the case of tree  cutting in Vrindavan would be requested to order the acquisition of land  for the Forest Department so that tree planting can be done there on a  massive scale.</p>
<p>The PPP programme can only be carried out on  roadsides and within private lands. But when we talk about the massive  tree plantation it should be done purely by the government as it  involves problems of encroachment and land grabbing, etc.</p>
<p>The restoration of the sacred groves and containing the monkey population was also discussed in the seminar.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDRthO6iW2I/AAAAAAAABpg/jPM-PiyZZlQ/s1600/DSCN1644+d.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TDRthO6iW2I/AAAAAAAABpg/jPM-PiyZZlQ/s400/DSCN1644+d.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></div>
<p>The  seminar was presided by Shri Bal Krishna Goutam. Dr. Chandra Prakash  Sharma, Shri Govind Kishor Goswami, Acharya Naresh Narain, K.G. Gupta,  Kanhaiya Gupta, Chandra Lal Sharma, Suresh Chandra Sharma, Rajendra  Agrawal, Jagannath Poddar, Totaram Upadhyay, Girdhari Brajwasi, Ram  Narayan Brajwasi, R.D. Singh (Forest Ranger), C.B. Singh (Deputy Forest  Ranger), O.P. Sharma (Forest Guard), Braj Mohan Khandal, Puran Kishor  Sharma, Govind Mahant, Ankit Agrawal, Jagdish, Vishnu Pada Das, Madhu  Mangal Shukla (petitioner) and many others participated in the seminar.</p>

<p>30th  June 2010: Some trees were being cut in the Raman Reti area by the  Electricity Department. People tried to stop them from cutting the  trees, informing them of the High Court&#8217;s order, which appeared in the  newspaper on that day. But instead of stopping their action, the workers  threatened the people who tried to stop them.</p>
<p>The people then  informed petitioner Madhumangal Shukla and the Friends of Vrindavan  office about the Electricity Department&#8217;s action. Several activists  immediately informed the District Forest Officer, D.L.Meena, about it  and then went to the spot accompanied by the media. The D.F.O. sent  their team to stop the cutting and took legal action against the  workers.</p>
<p>So that one tree was saved. It is noteworthy, however,  that hundreds of trees have already been cut in the name of road  broadening and sewer laying. The High Court of Allahabad has put an  injunction on cutting the trees after a PIL was filed by the  Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance.</p>
<p>Radhe Radhe!</p>

<p>Radhe Radhe! A meeting of the <strong>Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance</strong> is scheduled to be organised at the Bara Bagicha of Rangji Temple near  Katyayani Mandir on Tuesday, 6th July 2010 at 5 p.m. The Divisional  Director of the Uttar Pradesh Forestry (District Forest Officer) Dr.  K.L. Meena has given his consent to participate in the meeting. He  wishes to discuss about the massive tree plantation as compensation of  the trees cut in Vrindavan. This is very important and crucial meeting  about the future of Vrindavan&#8217;s ecology. So, kindly take out your  valuable time for this imprortant event if you are in the town.</p>

<p>Radhe Radhe! As you may know that the  Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance has filed a Public Interest Litigation  in the High Court of Allahabad through Madhu Mangal Shukla to protect  the trees and do the massive forestation in the Yamuna Bank. The <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/07/pil-stops-cutting-of-trees-high-court.html">first order of the High Court</a> is attached with this mail.</p>
<p>Madhumangal  Shukla has asked me to request all the well wishers of Vrindavan and  the BVHA members to generously donate to sustain the legal battle to  protect the identity of Vrindavan&#8217;s ecology. You may donate any amount  of money for this cause. It is up to you how you wish to support this  mission.</p>

<h3>Over 60 Lakhs of Pilgrims Do Govardhan Parikrama</h3>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TE0sZ2hyiOI/AAAAAAAABzo/XpSZVNOvoYk/s1600/25_muriya.jpg"></a>Govardhan (Based on reports from Dainik Jagran, 2010.07.25)।</p>
<p>The  popular festival of Muriya Purnima or Mooriya Poona ended on Sunday.  This is the biggest festival in Govardhan during the year and this year  official estimates state that more than six million pilgrims did the  parikrama of Giriraj.</p>
<p>The festival commemorates Guru Purnima,  which coincides with the disappearance day of Srila Sanatan Goswami, the  doyen of the six Goswamis of Vrindavan. The term <em>muriya</em> refers  to the shaving of heads that the Vaishnavas performed in mourning for  Sanatan Goswami. Since Sanatan is often credited with restarting the  practice of circumambulating Giriraj, this has became the principal way  of commemorating him. But visiting the major temples around  Govardha,including Mukharavind and Danghati, and bathing in the Manasa  Ganga and other tanks around Govardhan form part of the ritual.</p>
<p>The  last two months in Govardhan have been hectic as preparations have been  made, especially road-widening and removal of encroachments. High  security was everywhere, with CC cameras being used for the first time.</p>
<p>The  festival lasts five days, but of course the largest crowds come on the  full moon day itself. People came from many different states across  North India. From early morning crowds flooded onto the Parikrama Marg.  Caravans of pilgrims approached Govardhan, each with the cry of Jai  Giriraj Maharaj ki Jai on their lips. The same cry echoed everywhere on  the path.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TE0suJzH9XI/AAAAAAAAB0A/mTbqavgCVQo/s1600/800px-Guru-Purnima-Govardhan-Mathura-3.jpg"></a><br />
The  primary attraction at the Mela is the procession in honor of Sanatan  Goswami that left the Chakleshwar Radha Shyamasundar temple at 11,  headed by the picture of Sanatan Prabhu. Accompanied by sankirtan.  Offered obeisance to Sanatan.</p>
<p>The procession goes from  Chakleshwar, to Dasbisa, Bijali Ghara Tiraha, Sankh Adda, Danghati, Hati  Darwaja and back. Tamal Krishna Das Baba gave a lecture.</p>
<p>Arrangements  tested to their limits. Mathura Junction people coming back. People  risking their lives by hanging to the outside and roof of trains,  despite several extra trains. Not a square inch of space on the  platform. People fighting to get space, even on the rooftops of buses.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers down this year.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TE0spoe-iTI/AAAAAAAABz4/ZDauDlk618k/s1600/609px-Guru-Purnima-Govardhan-Mathura-14.jpg"></a><strong>The Muriya Mela has been called a &#8220;mini Kumbha,&#8221; but apparently </strong>the numbers were less this year, which is a matter of some concern in the local community.</p>
<p>The  estimates came in at six million whereas in previous years,  particularly in 2007 and 2008, the numbers were said to have passed ten  million. The record was set in 2006 when an estimate 15 million people  attended, but by last year, numbers had gone down to 8  million. Govardhan Development officer Hari Om Sharma said the reason  numbers are going doing is the lack of facilities.</p>
<p>Why are the  numbers going down? Certainly much less this year than predicted. Better  facilities than previously. B.D. Paulson, the police superintendent  says that since the road has been made wider all around Govardhan, it  now looks like there are less people.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TE0sNsOzALI/AAAAAAAABzQ/9KR0LB6zxzI/s1600/25muriya.jpg"></a>Since  there were no buildings on the road, etc., people were able to walk  easily. But there is some concern that attracting more people to the  mela is necessary. Mathura Prasad Kaushik, the head sevayat at the  Danghati temple said that it is not a good sign for Govardhan that less  people are coming. Visitors have to face many difficulties. Not everyone  wants to face the crowds and would rather come and do the parikrama on a  regular day.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TE0sxb6R8mI/AAAAAAAAB0I/PqUXDCqQWoE/s1600/800px-Mansi-Ganga-4.jpg"></a><br />
<strong>Deaths and Accidents</strong></p>
<p>One  pilgrimload of buses was forced to stop near Raya railway crossing. As  the driver was dealing with the problem, the passengers got out. A car  coming from behind ran into the bus. Several people were injured and two  woman, one from Aligarh the other from Meerut, died. Several of the  others are still in critical condition. Another person was killed on the  road near the Jaygurudeva temple.</p>
<p>During the mela, three people drowned. Because of it, people in need of first aid had to wait long hourse before getting it.</p>
<p>As  a safety measure, the PAC had a motorboat on the Manasa Ganga and  divers stood at the ready. Microphones were sending out warnings of deep  water, which were also cordoned off.Despite all these preventive actions, two accidents happened.</p>
<p>One  woman from Agra, another from Faridabad drowned. One of the women was  taken to the Govardhan general clinic, but there were no doctors  available. She was taken to a private clinic and treated, and then  refered to the Mathura health center, but the drive took three hours and  by the time they reached, she was dead. They asked the driver to stop  at some other health center on the way, but he refused. When she was  dead, the family members started a riot in the hospital.<br />
One pilgrim died of a heart attack in a guest house at Radha Kund while resting after the parikrama.</p>
<p>Radhe Radhe!</p>

<hr />
Here  I am, popping up on a borrowed computer to remind everyone: If  something (petitioning for Braj as an Eco-Sensitive Area – or ESA) seems  too good to be true (i.e. a clear, direct and relatively quick  process), then it probably is!</p>
<p>The declaration of Braj as an  Eco-sensitive area would be a great achievement. It would limit reckless  development and require eco-conscious master planning. However, there  are formidable hurdles to clear, namely:</p>
<p>1. The fact that Braj is  a large (about 3800 sq. km.) and includes not only several large cities  in their entirety but also spans three separate Indian states is a  hindrance. Protection of such a large area containing urban centres has  not been extended thus far, but this does not mean that Braj cannot be  the first. It is encouraging that Mount Abu, including its town (which  is a little less than half the size of Vrindavan) has recently been  declared an ESA. (official notification on Mount Abu can be found <a href="http://www.envfor.nic.in/legis/eia/191e.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>2.  Again, the lack of a clearly delineated process for achieving the goal  will serve as a frustration. The application process, grounds for  advocating protection and even the official definition of an ESA are  unclear. This led the Pune and Delhi based non-profit Kalpavriksh to  create a report (<a href="http://assets.wwfindia.org/downloads/indias_notified_ecologicallysensitive_areas.pdf">here</a>)  detailing the history of ESA’s and how they have been acquired,  including several specific case studies. According to the report’s  introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…these (ESA) clauses have been used  only by a few actors mainly because of the lack of knowledge about the  scope of ESAs and also due to the MoEF’s ambiguity in notifying them.”  and, “…due to incomplete informa¬tion, many proposals that were  submitted to the MoEF are still pending or were subsequently rejected as  they did not meet the MoEF’s criteria”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Specific case studies by Kalpavriksh make two conditions for success clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>A  large, cohesive and vocal group supporting ESA status. This is where we  can all help. The BVHA is doing a great job of getting the ball  rolling, but the organization needs to be more transparent and inclusive  of all members in terms of meeting attendance, opinion/logistics  sharing and fundraising (the particulars of this are for another  discussion). Bringing everyone together – in body, name and spirit –  will lend not only the BVHA strength but also a great deal more  credibility. Past successes involve numerous NGO’s and public/political  figures united for the common cause of ESA status.</li>
<li>A  well-informed, intelligent argument for the cause of protection. The  religious significance of Braj is well-known and we need to go beyond  this in our arguments (Please note: I am not saying that this aspect  should be ignored; I am simply saying that it cannot be a stand alone  argument). The Kalpavriksh report notes that success in the past has  come from arguing along the lines of benchmarks made by the Ministry of  Environment and Forests (MoEF) itself. For example, the Kalpavriksh  report cited the MoEF report from the 80’s entitled, “‘Parameters for  Determining Ecological Fragility” as critical in supporting the case for  Dahanu (near Mumbai). A quick search revealed a 2000 report revisiting  the “‘Parameters for Determining Ecological Fragility.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone  who is serious about helping the cause to make Braj an Eco-Sensitive  Area should look at this MoEF report and start building arguments around  that. Here is the <a href="http://www.elaw.org/system/files/Pranab+Sen+committee+report+2000.DOC">link</a>.  One can also look at <a href="http://envfor.nic.in/legis/eco-senstive.htm">all ESA notifications by the MoEF</a> to see what arguments made in the past can also work for Braj.</p>
<p>Granted,  we are only beginning to embark upon this effort. However, I find it  important for supporters to know exactly what we are getting into, what  it entails, and how we can best help. I look forward to hearing the  outcome of the BVHA delegation’s visit with Sri Jai Ram Ramesh so we can  learn how best to proceed and make our every effort count as much as  possible!</p>
<p>Vrindavan dham ki jai!</p>

<p>Radhe Radhe! The Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance  (BVHA) is seeking to get the whole Braj region to be declared as an  Eco-Sensitive Zone.</p>
<p>We are in process of sending one  representation to Shri Jai Ram Ramesh, Hon&#8217;ble Minister of Environment  &amp; Forest, requesting him to declare Braj, with the focus on  Vrindavan, as an Eco-Sensitive Zone.</p>
<p>It will be very helpful if you can send some of your views to us on why Braj &amp; Vrindavan should be declared as such.</p>
<p>Your valuable comments will help us immensely to draft the petition. Kindly send your suggestions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Pranams,</p>
<p>Yours in service</p>

<div>Devotees  from all around the world are mourning the passing of His Grace Aindra  Prabhu, the leader of the 24-hour kirtan at the Iskcon Krishna Balaram  temple in Vrindavan, who entered Radha and Krishna&#8217;s nitya-lila this  morning at 7.15 AM.</div>
<div><a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs223.snc4/38484_1538724549812_1285845433_31490441_4853911_n.jpg"><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs223.snc4/38484_1538724549812_1285845433_31490441_4853911_n.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="153" height="200" /></a></div>
<div>He  was found in his room doing dandavat pranams in front of Goura Nitai,  his personal deities. A devotee, who always helped him to serve his  deity, tried to open the door this morning, but when there was no  answer, he had the door broken open, and Aindra Prabhu was found lying  in silent obeisances before the Lord.</div>
<div>His  Grace Aindra Prabhu, a direct disciple of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami  Prabhupada, was in charge of the 24-hour kirtan at ISKCON Krishna  Balaram Mandir as ordained by Srila Prabhupada. His sincere devotion and  commitment generated a pure spiritual atmosphere in the temple and  strengthened perfect devotion in the minds of all visitors to the holy  abode.</div>
<div>Aindra  Prabhu received Harinama diksha in 1973 in Washington D.C. For many  years he served as a pujari at the temple and regularly engaged in  Harinama sankirtan and book distribution. After several visits to  Vrindavan Dham, he was inspired to revitalize the 24-hour kirtan which  had originally been started at the Krishna Balaram Mandir in 1975.</div>
<div>In  1986, Aindra Prabhu came to establish himself permanently in the Holy  Dham, from which time he fully committed himself to the service of the  Holy Name in the form of Maha Mantra kirtan, inspiring thousands of  devotees from India and around the world with his great enthusiasm and  melodious chanting. His wonderful devotional recordings have spread far  and wide, bringing joy to the hearts of thousands of devotees.</div>
<div>May  your chants remind you of Vrindavan and the blessings of Radharani and  Shyamasundar be with you forever. We cherish your glories always in  Vrindavan and may you live forever in the memories of all the devotees  of Vrindavan. May you be ever absorbed in the glorious pastimes of Radha  Krishna, always singing their holy names for their pleasure in the  nitya lila.</div>

<p>July  14th 2010. A meeting of the Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance was  organized at Kishore Van. The meeting was chaired by Dr. K.L. Meena,  Divisional Director of Uttar Pradesh Forestry.</p>
<p>It was resolved  that the BVHA is very serious about getting the entire Braj be declared  as the Eco Sensitive Zone, focusing on Vrindavan. They said if Braj is  declared an eco-sensitive zone, then the hills, trees and water bodies  can be saved from the greed of the developers. Moreover, the  agricultural land around Vrindavan and Govardhan would not be used for  the construction new colonies.</p>
<p>The Braj heritage has to be  conserved at any cost and, if needed, people are ready to give their  lives for it. A delegation of the BVHA will meet the Union Environment  Minister for this cause.</p>
<p>Shri Govind Kishor Goswami, Sevait of  Kishor Van, said that the celebration of 500th birth anniversary of Shri  Hari Ram Ji Vyas will begin from 26th November, 2010. He asked that the  BVHA be fully involved and participate in this event and help him to  bring celebrity singers from Mumbai who can sing the Sakis and Pads Shri  Hari Ram Ji Vyas. The alliance members unanimously approved his  request.</p>
<p>Shri Goswami also said that he welcomes everyone to  support the joint initiative of Friends of Vrindavan and BVHA to restore  the Sacred Grove of Kishor Van. He said though he is the Sevait of  Kishor Van but worshipping and adoring the Lord is everyone’s right.  There is no restriction entering the temple and the grove. Any devotee  who respects the rules of the sacred grove of Kishor Van is welcome to  visit and practice his rituals here. He is ready to enter into an  agreement with anyone whoever helps him to restore Kishor Van.</p>
<p>Shri Ghanshyam Kishor Goswami, son of Shri Govind Kishor Goswami also agreed with this arrangement.</p>
<p>Shri  Govind Sharma, Sevait of Vanshi Vat said that he was also willing to  restore the sacred grove of Vanshi Vat. The BVHA may adopt Vanshi Vat  once the project of Kishor Van accomplished. He said that  all the  temples should be encouraged to restore their gardens and water bodies.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TD79zHFEpHI/AAAAAAAABvI/mCrnKqXpm7U/s1600/klmeena2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TD79zHFEpHI/AAAAAAAABvI/mCrnKqXpm7U/s320/klmeena2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Dr.  K.L. Meena in his presidential address said that he will save the  biggest plants of Kadamba, Tamal and other typical trees from his  nurseries to be planted in the BVHA projects. He also declared that all  sort of technical support will be given by the U.P. Forestry to restore  Kishor Van. He took away a sample of the soil from Kishor Van to be  tested in the laboratory of the Forestry Department.</p>
<p>He said that  it is the responsibility of the local bodies to relocate the stray  animals. If the municipality or any one takes the responsibility of  relocation of the monkeys he can give the NOC (no objection  certificate). He said that the first step to restore Kishor Van is to  cover it with iron nets only. This area is dominated by the monkeys,  thus no fencing can stop them from coming inside the grove.</p>
<p>Present  in the meeting were: Govind Kishor Goswami, Naresh Narain, Ghanshyam  Kishor Goswami, Madhumangal Shukla, Kanhaiya Gupta, Sushil Chandra  Sharma, Dr. Chandra Prakash Sharma, Ram Narin Brajwasi, Govind Mahant,  Pratibha Sharma, Manju Sharma, Bal Krishna Goutam, Shyam Lal Sharma,  Indra Prakash Pahuja, Ankit Agrawal, Braj Mohan Khandal, Krishna Gopal  Gupta, Ravindra Kulshreshtha, Jagannath Poddar, Avishek Shrivastava.</p>
<p>Radhe Radhe !</p>

Siddiqui at Jugal Kishor temple in Keshi  Ghat, BVHA delegates asked that the right to information requests sent  to the Agra office of the ASI be responded to. Today, after a long wait,  the following answers were given in a letter received today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reply  from the Archeological Survey of India, Agra under the Right to  Information for the construction of the half circular flyover in front  of the Kesi Ghat.</p>
<p>(1) Was the No Objection certificate sought from the ASI before starting the construction of the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>Ans. The NOC was not taken from the Archaeological Survey of India before constructing the bridge.</strong></p>
<p>(2) How far is the bridge from the ASI protected Jugal Kishor Temple?</p>
<p><strong>Ans. It is within the 300 meter area from the ASI protected monument.</strong></p>
<p>(3) What actions did the ASI take when the information on construction of the bridge came to its notice?</p>
<p><strong>Ans.  We asked the concerned department to stop the construction of the  bridge as soon as it came to our notice and we wrote letter to the local  administration requesting them to stop the illegal construction.</strong></p>
<p>(4) Is the construction permissible under the new law of the regulated area of ASI?</p>
<p><strong>Ans.   As per the law there can’t be any construction with the Ariel distance  of 100 meters. The construction can be permitted within the regulated  area with some conditions if the concerned person or agency applies in  the prescribed format.</strong></p>
<p>Sd/- Anil (Central Public Information Officer)</p></blockquote>
<p>Also,  it should be noted that in PIL 36311, stopping the cutting of trees,  the Court extended  the time for filing a counter affidavit by a further  period of four weeks from July 13. The interim order shall remain in  effect till further orders.</p>

Siddiquie, Superintending Archaeologist  of Agra Circle visited the ASI protected monuments of Govind Dev and  Yugal Kishor in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>On Sunday last some pieces of the  roof fell into the temple compound at the Govinda Deva temple. Luckily  no one was present at the time and so there was no injury. Still the  matter was one of concern to the ASI and occasioned the visit. He gave  some instructions to the local caretakers and then went to the Yugal  Kishor temple, where he also inspected the location where the half-moon  bridge was being built near Kesi Ghat. javascript:void(0)</p>
<p>A  delegation of the Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance comprised of Acharya  Naresh Narain, Madhumangal Shukla, Ram Narain Brajwasi, Ravindra  Kulshreshtha, Manmohan Pareekh and Jagannath Poddar met the  Superintending Archaeologist at the Yugal Kishor Temple.</p>
<p>The  delegation demanded that the ASI protected monuments be properly taken  care of and that no construction should be allowed around them as per  the law. Mr. Siddiqui asked for all concerned with the protection of  these monuments to report to him if there is any construction around  them and that he will take immediate action against it.</p>
<p>When people asked him if the ASI supports the construction of the bridge he replied in the negative.</p>
<p>The Alliance members requested him to make a reply of the Right to Information letter sent to him one month back.</p>
<p>The  BVHA members also demanded that the historical Kesi Ghat be protected  by the Archaeological Survey of India. Mr. Siddiqui said that the  Alliance should ask the District Magistrate to write a letter to the  Director General of the ASI about the protection of this ghat of  religious importance.</p>

<p>Lakhs of pilgrims bathe in Suraj Kund.</p>
<p>In the midst of tight security, thousands of pilgrims bathed in Suraj Kund Saturday. Recent events on <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/mob-attacks-police-post-frees-men-detained-for-misbehaviour/108473.html">July 3</a>,  when a group of miscreants harassed women bathers and then got into a  fight with the police, did not dampen the enthusiasm of the devotees.</p>
<p>Despite  the heavy security arrangements, the devotees gathered in large  numbers. The Bihariji temple was especially nicely arranged with flower  decorations (<em>phul bangalo</em>)</p>
<p>The Kokilavan temple is an  important center for pilgrimage with thousands coming on Saturdays for  darshan of the deity. A major festival takes place when Saturday  coincides with Amavashya. This temple is said to be the place where  Krishna gave darshan of Shanideva (Saturn).</p>
<p>People come to this  temple from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and further afield. Amongst the  dignitaries who visited Saturday and bathed in the Suraj Kund were  Rajasthan High Court judge Madan Mohan Sharma and the DM Dinesh Kumar.  Mahanta Prema Das Maharaj welcomed the honoured guests.</p>
<p>Crowds were so thick that darshan and puja were conducted with difficulty.</p>

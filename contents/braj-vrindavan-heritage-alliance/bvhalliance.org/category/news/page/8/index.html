<p>Minutes of the meeting of Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance (BVHA)</p>
<p>Place: Shringar Vat; 16th June 2010</p>
<p>Those  present: Shri Anoop Goswami, Shri Bal Krishna Goutam, Shri Kiran  Goswami, Acharya Shrivatsa Goswami, Shri Govind Kishor Goswami, Shri Ram  Narayan Brajwasi, Pandit Damodar Sharma,  Shri Krishna Gopal Gupta,  Jagannath Poddar, Ms. Pratibha Sharma, Dr. Chandra Prakash Sharma, Shri  Madhumangal Shukla, Shri Ravindra Kulshreshtha, Shri Rajendra Agrawal,  Puran Kishor Sharma, Suresh Chandra Sharma, Braj Mohan Sharma, Shri  Indra Pahuja, Shri Yogesh Agrawal, Shri Abhishek Shrivastava</p>
<p>Chair: Thakur Shri Nityananda Mahaprabhu through His servant Shri Anup Goswami</p>
<p>The following topics were discussed in the meeting &amp; unanimously resolved:</p>
<p>The  projects under the Vrindavan Samgra Vikas Yojna is being implemented  arbitrarily which is unlawful and against the environment and culture of  Vrindavan. There is no sense of laying sewerage line and drainage by  damaging the ancient monuments ghats of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>There is no use of such drains as they are directed towards Yamuna.</p>
<p>This project is killing Vrindavan more than benefiting the town.</p>
<p>The  broad drains will make the streets narrower and will leave no room for  more than one vehicle at a time. While the roads leading to the  different temples of Vrindavan are already narrow, such developments  will result in more traffic congestion and leave Vrindavan at a stand  still.</p>
<p>People were much concerned over how the Jagannath  Rathyatra from the different temples will pass on these streets to Gyan  Gudri if it is broken.</p>
<p>It was decided that a letter should be  sent immediately to the authorities by giving a week’s ultimatum to  check the unplanned developments; otherwise different ways of  demonstrative actions will be adopted. People even said that they  wouldn’t shy to go for the hunger strike till death to save the land of  Lord Krishna.</p>
<p>It was also decided to invite Shri Jayant Singh  (Member of Parliament from Mathura) in the next meeting and share the  concerns with him and request him to take the issue to the Indian  Parliament.</p>

<p><em>Sorry  I have been a bit negligent about daily posting Vṛndāvana-Mahimāmṛtam. I  am glad to do it, to relish these verses with their mad mood of  renunciation, the disorganized jumping around from condemnations of  those who don&#8217;t see the transcendental beauty of Vrindavan, who don&#8217;t  see the presence of Radha and Krishna, who think the people and  creatures of Vrindavan are like any other mortals&#8230; It is a kind of  madness, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>And no doubt those who think that the  quest to serve and preserve Vrindavan is also a kind of folly. Politics  and economics, these things stir passions, but passions about ineffable  things, about vague things like religious heritage is just so medieval.  What place could it possibly have in the modern world?</p>
<p>What can  I say folks? Seva. Bhakti means seva. And seva of the Dham is the best  seva because seva in the Dham incorporates all the five best kinds of  bhakti. This is a preaching site, my friends. </em>kurvann eveha karmani<em>:  Service in the state of knowledge is called bhakti. This is not  karma-yoga, this is prema-bhakti-yoga. Find out how to serve. If you  have faith in the Dham, find out how to serve. If you don&#8217;t have faith,  read Vṛndāvana-Mahimāmṛtam, and may you find Prabodhananda&#8217;s madness  attractive.</p>
<p>These are tough verses today. Each one of them raises questions&#8230; Old Prabodhanandaji knew his Upanishads&#8230;</em></p>

Mentioned there was the Taj Heritage Corridor Affair, which came to  prominence in 2002-2003. Several similarities and differences with the  Vrindavan situation can be pointed out. It seems to be no accident that  the same Sushri Mayawati who was CM of UP during the THC affair is  following the same MO in the current situation.</p>

<h3><span>Taj corridor project compromises heritage</span></h3>
<p></a><br />
Author: Kushal P S Yadav 30/07/2003, Source: Down to Earth.</p>
<p>“Leaving  aside the human lives, protection of Taj Mahal is of utmost priority.”   Supreme Court in M C Mehta vs Union of India case on Taj Mahal</p>
<p>Sadly,  preserving Taj Mahal appeared to be the last thing on the authorities’  mind when they allowed land reclamation work to continue for six months  on the dried-up Yamuna riverbed right in the monument’s backyard. They  may actually end up scripting its epitaph, because experts fear that the  monsoon-ravaged new embankment could weaken the very foundations of the  Taj.</p>
<p>The hectic activity, from December 2002 to June 2003, in  the vicinity of India’s biggest tourist attraction was in fact the  groundwork for the Rs 175-crore Taj Heritage Corridor (THC) Project that  proposed to give a facelift to the areas surrounding Agra’s major  monuments along the Yamuna. Included in the venture was a blueprint for a  swanky shopping mall. The grandiose scheme, however, fell to pieces  when it came under media scrutiny in mid-June 2003.</p>
<p>Even as the  issue snowballed into a major controversy, both the Union and Uttar  Pradesh (UP) governments washed their hands of the matter. They would  have us believe that the entire clandestine operation was the handiwork  of one bureaucrat of UP, who has since been suspended. But documents  pertaining to the case tell a different story: while the state  government tailored an environment plan to its needs, the Union  government also turned a blind eye to the manoeuvrings. It has come to  light that the project had got underway without any of the mandatory  clearances. Furthermore, the work was in violation of several  stipulations such as those imposed by the Supreme Court (SC).</p>
<p>As  the dust settles, it is quite evident that not only were cultural and  heritage issues cast aside to pave the way for the venture,  environmental concerns too were ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Plan gone awry</strong></p>
<p>The  thc plan was put forward by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)  and consultancy firm German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) in 2001. It was  part of a series of proposals collectively referred to as the  ‘Environment Management Plan &#8212; Agra’. Under THC, the CPCB had  conceptualised a heritage corridor covering five historical monuments,  including Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Ram Bagh, Etmad-ud-Daula’s tomb and  Chini ka Rauza.</p>
<p>“While the scheme involved taking steps such as  development of a green belt and landscaping, it was never once suggested  that this should be done by reclaiming land from the riverbed,” claims a  CPCB official.</p>
<p>These plans, and others, were submitted to the  Union Ministry Of Environment And Forests (MOEF) as well as local  authorities in Agra. “Rules mandate that detailed project reports (DPRS)  should be prepared at this stage by the relevant departments in the  state government. They should then be submitted to the MOEF, and funds  sought under the Taj Protection Mission (TPM),” explains an Environment  Ministry official.</p>
<p>Jointly set up by the Union and UP  governments, TPM envisages improving the environment around the  monuments through various projects. These schemes are administered by a  body called the Mission Management Board (MMB).</p>
<p>For its part, the  UP Government did not bother to submit the DPRS. It dispensed with  other procedures, too, and unilaterally decided to give the green light  to the the project. In November 2002, the then principal secretary  (environment), R K Sharma, released a sum of Rs 17 crore for preliminary  work.</p>
<p>Sharma has been inexplicably singled out and suspended.  Evidence suggests that the MMB was responsible for initiating the THC  project (see box: Procedural lapses). It cleared the proposal in its  August 2002 meeting, which was chaired by up chief secretary D S Bagga.  Ironically, Bagga himself was later asked to conduct an inquiry into the  matter by up chief minister (CM) Mayawati.</p>
<p>The first tranche of  funds was released in November 2002 and work commenced in the very next  month. The contract was awarded to the National Projects Construction  Company (NPCC), a public sector undertaking.</p>
<p>“It is highly  unlikely that Mayawati and Bagga were unaware of the goings-on,” feels a  senior official of the UP Government. This seems plausible because the  money could not have been released without the finance department’s  consent, and the CM holds the finance portfolio.</p>
<p>After the issue  came in the public gaze, the Union Minister For Culture And Tourism,  Jagmohan, instructed the Mayawati government to stop work on THC. “It is  astounding that such a project was being executed so close to the  complex,” remarked Jagmohan.</p>
<p>Significantly, even the  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) &#8212; which comes under the Union  Ministry For Culture And Tourism &#8212; is said to have stayed abreast of  the developments. For their part, MOEF officials acknowledge that they  did have an inkling of the events but claim that the details were  divulged to them only recently.</p>
<p><strong>Plot thickens </strong></p>
<p>On  March 26, 2003, an application was filed in the SC in the M C Mehta  versus Union of India case. It contended that the up government was  diverting the flow of the Yamuna by reclaiming about 75 acres (30.4  hectares) of land between Agra Fort and Taj Mahal. The SC asked the CPCB  to submit a report on the issue.</p>
<p>On April 7, the CPCB filed an  affidavit asserting it had never suggested that the riverbed be filled  up at the site. On the contrary, the board was of the view that  construction at the spot could adversely affect the hydrology of the  river, cause air pollution and alter the landscape of the region.</p>
<p>On  May 1, the SC ordered the UP Government to bring to a halt all  construction activity at the site. Appallingly, the directive was  complied with only a month and a half later when the media blew the lid  off the matter.</p>
<p>“The controversy grabbed the headlines because it  involved the prestigious Taj Mahal,” opines K C Joshi, former director  general of ASI. He adds: “Thousands of other monuments in the country  are in a shambles. Though laws to protect such structures do exist, they  are not stringent enough.”</p>
<p><strong>Structural inadequacies </strong></p>
<p>“It  shall be the duty of every citizen of India to value and preserve the  rich heritage of our composite culture,” states Article 51 A (F) of the  Constitution. Its seventh schedule also empowers the Union and State  Governments to frame laws for the protection and upkeep of monuments.</p>
<p>“The  statute provides a wide scope in this regard,” reveals Ritwick Dutta, a  Delhi-based environmental lawyer. “Each state can have its own set of  regulations,” he adds.</p>
<p>Subject to the fulfilment of certain  criteria, the Union government can declare a particular monument to be  of national importance. The ASI is in charge of preserving such  structures at the central level. Currently, there are more than 3,500  structures in the ASI’s protected monuments’ list.</p>
<p>Monuments of  national and regional importance are governed by the Ancient and  Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, and  state legislations, respectively. The central act lays down guidelines  relating to the siting of structures around protected monuments. It  prohibits construction within 100 metres (m) of a protected monument and  regulates activities within 300 m of the spot.</p>
<p>“This rule is  flouted time and again,” points out Joshi, citing the case of Qutab  Minar in Delhi. “There is an entire settlement within a few metres of  the monument,” he says.</p>
<p>Other experts concur with Joshi on the  issue of the laws being toothless. “The 100 m or 300 m rule  notwithstanding, no protection is provided to the areas surrounding a  monument,” alleges Ratish Nanda, a Delhi-based conservation architect.  “In case of monuments like the Taj, the entire setting &#8212; including the  skyline &#8212; is crucial for preserving the site’s integrity. But the law  is silent on this aspect,” adds Nanda. He opines that even building  bylaws need to be primed for the conservation of heritage complexes.</p>
<p>The  example of Delhi’s Jantar Mantar illustrates this point. Jantar Mantar  is an astronomical observatory built by Jai Singh II of Jaipur in 1724.  It houses a huge sundial and other instruments that can measure astral  movements. The direct rays of the sun play a crucial role in the  functioning of these devices.</p>
<p>“In the 1980s, the New Delhi  Municipal Council constructed its new multi-storeyed building near  Jantar Mantar. The building’s shadow fell on the monument and blocked  the sunlight. As a result, the clocks stopped working,” observes Joshi.  “Today it stands as a mere sand and brick structure. We failed to  preserve the symbol of ancient scientific progress,” he laments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  even as the Taj Heritage Corridor row is yet to die down, doubts are  being expressed about how long the monument can continue to retain its  World Heritage Site status. The United Nations Educational, Scientific  and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) office in New Delhi is reported to  have apprised the World Heritage Centre (WHC), Paris, of the details of  the case.</p>
<p>According to the UNESCO’s ‘Convention Concerning the  Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage’, member states  should ensure that nothing interferes with the “authenticity and  integrity of the site.” India ratified the pact in 1977 and currently  has more than 25 such sites.</p>
<p>It may be noted that in 1999,  construction activity around Hampi in Karnataka had prompted the WHC to  include the monument in a list of endangered heritage sites. Is the Taj  &#8212; which is visited by about 5,000 tourists daily &#8212; headed in the same  direction?</p>

<em>There are many similarities, as stated  above, between what the government did then and what it has been doing  in Vrindavan. Unfortunately, the lesson they seem to have learned is  that you do it quicker and with less information, and with so much  suffering inflicted on the people during the course of the work that  they beg, beg the government to just please finish it!! </em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>Anyway,  the essence seems to be passing off a profiteering scheme &#8220;in the garb  of an environment-cum-heritage project.&#8221; When you see this Parikrama  Marg project being sold as &#8220;beautification&#8221; you see how Nuspeak has  descended into the PR department of the UP Government, the MVDA and all  the rest of the people behind it. </em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>If anything,  it seems that this time around, all the authorities acted with even  more cynicism and callousness than in the Taj Heritage case. Indeed,  looking at the pictures, it is clear that far more damage has already  been and is still being done with this Vrindavan Project than would have  been done even if they had managed to complete the THC. </em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>How  people failed to see the pattern is amazing! And how it is that the  people of Agra were able to come together to protest with more vigor  than the Vrindavan-vasis, most of whom seem to have had the wool covered  over their eyes?</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>But I think that Central  Government anxieties about the Commonwealth Games and the hope to  maximize the development gains that could be made with this entry onto  the world scene is what really led to the great and mindless haste to  finish this project. </em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>Mayawati obviously sees  herself as a proud leader and agent of change and economic  modernization. But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and a  five-storey mall casting shadows on the Taj Mahal certainly must have  looked beautiful to someone who had dollar signs in his eyes. Just as  this flyover masking the Yamuna and Keshi Ghat could only look beautiful  to someone who still thinks of the future with the mind of a  science-fiction buff from the 1950&#8242;s. &#8212; Jagat</em></p>

June 9th, 2010 &#8211; 5:49 pm ICT by IANS (<a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/">Thaindian</a>)</p>
<p>Agra,  June 9 (IANS) The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked for  immediately stopping construction of a bridge on the river Yamuna here  as it is quite close to a Mughal era monument.</p>
<p>Superintending  Archaeologist A.R. Siddiqui told IANS: “We have asked the Uttar Pradesh  State Bridge Corporation Limited to stop construction and seek clearance  from ASI headquarters in New Delhi.”</p>
<p>This, he said, had been  done as new rules have come into force, according to which construction  within 300 metres of a protected monument is regulated and can be  continued after a green signal from the ASI headquarters.</p>
<p>The  monument in question is Etmauddaula, built by Noor Jahan, the favourite  wife of Mughal emperor Jahangir, as a mausoleum for her father Mirza  Giyas Beg.</p>
<p>The bridge on the river Yamuna was slated to be  completed before the Commonwealth Games in October. More than half the  work is already over, according to the site workers and engineers.</p>
<p>Braj Mandal Heritage Conservation Society president Surendra Sharma welcomed the ASI initiative, saying it was “long overdue”.</p>
<p>“They  should not have, in the first place, allowed construction so close,  hardly 200 metres from the Etmauddaula. They had misled the officials.  Even the local ASI officials goofed up and ignored the protests from  conservationists,” he said.</p>
<p>The controversial bridge is not likely to be completed now as the ASI headquarter is firm on following its latest norms.</p>
<p>“Especially after the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/24004637/1-Introduction">Taj Heritage Corridor</a> controversy, the ASI has become particularly sensitive to these issues,” an official said. (See also <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET-Cetera/Another-Taj-project-runs-into-trouble/articleshow/4848437.cms">Another Taj Project runs into trouble</a>).</p>
<p>Local  conservationists were particularly angry as the new bridge suddenly  turned right in violation of the original design submitted.</p>
<p>“This  would have obstructed the view of the beautiful Mughal building  Etmauddaula that is older than the Taj Mahal,” said Ravi Singh, a  conservationist.</p>
<p>“There have been gross violations of heritage  conservation guidelines and every time the ASI reacted late. This time  too the ASI has woken up late after more than half the bridge is  complete,” hotelier Sandip Arora said.</p>

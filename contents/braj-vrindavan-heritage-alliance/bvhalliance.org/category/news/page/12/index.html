PRESS RELEASE</p>
<p>Vrindavan, May 22nd, 2010: <a href="http://www.friendsofvrindavan.com/">Friends of Vrindavan</a> celebrated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_Biological_Diversity">International Day for Biological Diversity</a> (World Biodiversity Day) in Vrindavan. A seminar and a tree plantation drive was organised at Kishore Van.</p>
<p>The  speakers said that the sacred forests and groves have always been a  defining characteristic of Vrindavan and the larger Braj region of which  Vrindavan is a part. These green areas, along with various kunds and  the Yamuna River, are glorified in detail in the Bhagavat Purana and the  timeless poetry and literature of such great figures as Surdas, Rupa  Goswami and Jayadev. Together, these natural features constitute the  foundation of the area’s environmental heritage, creating the vision of  Vrindavan that exists in the popular imagination and devotional musings  of people all over the world.</p>
<p>Currently, this environmental  heritage is under sustained attack from thoughtless development and  mismanagement as businesses and institutions scramble to obtain quick  money from pilgrimage and tourism. The kunds, both sacred sites and  traditional rainwater harvesting catchments, are silted and going dry,  and the Yamuna River is a waste canal that serves as a breeding ground  for disease. The sacred groves of Vrindavan are nearly extinct: only a  handful of specific spaces and trees remain, and even these have been  ravaged by water shortages and a population of monkeys that is too large  for the town to sustain.</p>
<p>Only three of the many sacred groves  of Vrindavan are still in existence today. These are Nidhivan, Seva Kunj  and Kishore Van. Kishore Van is the smallest of the three and thus a  good place to begin the efforts of reviving and conserving it.</p>
<p>Pilgrimage  and tourism both will vanish along with environmental heritage if the  rush for growth continues to go on unchecked. People stand to lose not  only their heritage, but their livelihoods as well. Now is the time to  reverse this process by making people see that conservation can be more  profitable than destruction, especially in the long run. The ongoing  degradation of Vrindavan’s environment is rapidly severing a vital link  between the religio-cultural significance of the area and the people who  live and make pilgrimages here.</p>
<p>By restoring and conserving  sacred groves, Sacred Groves Conservation and Revival (SGCR) can help  reestablish this link and communicate the need to rescue the entirety of  Braj-Vrindavan’s endangered environmental heritage. Friends of  Vrindavan (FoV) declared to adopt Kishore Van for the revival of its  sacred grove with the participation from the local community.</p>
<p>The  function was addressed by His Holiness Acharya Shrivatsa Goswami,  Acharya Naresh Narayan, Shri Arvind Kumar (Uttar Pradesh Pollution  Control Board), Shri Govind Kishor Goswami, Shri Bal Krishna Gautam,  Shri Neeraj Agrawal (Secretary &#8211; GLA Institute of Technology and  Management, Dr. Chandra Prakash Sharma (Secretary &#8211; Brajwasi Panda  Sabha), Shri Sushil Chandra Sharma, Shri Brajendra Goswami, Shri  Anshuman Gopal Ji, Dr. Devendra Chaitanya Brahmachari, and many others.  The vote of thanks was given by Shri Pradyumna Pratap Singh.</p>

<strong>Road widening creates turmoil in Vrindavan</strong></p>
<p>(based on Amar Ujala article, May 22, 2010)</p>
<p>Bulldozers  were at work again in Vrindavan yesterday in the Vidyamandir market  area, tearing down all buildings that encroach on designated municipal  property.</p>
<p>Under the greater development scheme of Vrindavan, in  order to permit road widening on the Raman Reti Road, all buildings that  stand in the way are being destroyed. This work resumed on Friday. The  municipal authority’s campaign began in Raman Reti and has now reached  the Hari Nikunj intersection.</p>
<p>The campaign was led by City Magistrate Kumar Singh and C.O. Ashutosh Dvivedi.</p>
<p>Accompanied  by police and PAC, bulldozing began from the Vidyamandir Market at  about 9 a.m. In the midst of a heavy police presence, encroaching  portions of many buildings&#8211;Shorawala, the water fountain at Balaji  Ashram , Fogla Ashram, Hanuman Tekari, Shyama Bai School, Vrinda Foods,  Sadhu Bela, Yamuna Dham, Neha Nikunja and many other pakka  buildings&#8211;were torn down using JCB machinery.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the PWD and Municipal authorities came out to survey the road between the Hari Nikunj and Vidya Pith intersections.</p>
<p>As the bulldozers advanced, owners of the affected businesses and other buildings expressed their distress.</p>
<p>Many  ashrams of holy men, poor people’s homes and shops were knocked down.  On the other hand, there was an angry display that the homes of rich and  influential people were spared.</p>
<p>Other than this, it should be  noted that in the course of this campaign, Braj Bihari Colony, Iskcon  and several other institutions that were affected, have gotten a stay  order from the court.</p>
<p>Political parties have appealed for  compensation for those affected by the campaign, as this is a matter of  the livelihoods of many.</p>

<p>Organizations like UNESCO and INTACH insist  that if we want sensible development that will protect heritage in  Vrindavan, we need to focus on the municipality, namely the mayor and  the Nagar Palika Parishad. This is based on the 73rd and 74th amendments  to the Indian Constitution, which initiated a process of  decentralization of power to panchayats and urban local bodies. However,  implementation of these amendments has been “tardy and uneven,”(1)  leaving municipalities like ours here in Vrindavan unable to tread water  in terms of finance and provision of services.</p>
<p>Some of this may  be common knowledge for Indians, but I am going to present some  information on municipalities in India and Uttar Pradesh in particular,  including service provision responsibilities, revenue and obstacles to  adequate functioning. A conversation with Neeraj Saigal, General Manager  at Food for Life Vrindavan, inspired me to compile this information. I  hope that some of you find it useful in formulating opinions about what  should be done to improve Vrindavan’s situation, as well as by whom and  how.</p>
<p>First of all, in Uttar Pradesh, the following services are listed as being the responsibility municipality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing water supply for domestic, industrial and commercial purposes;</li>
<li>Establishing,  maintaining and assisting maternity centers and child welfare and birth  control clinics and promoting population control, family welfare and  small family norms;</li>
<li>Regulating tanneries;</li>
<li>Construction and maintenance of parking lots, bus stops and public conveniences;</li>
<li>Promoting urban forestry and ecological aspects and protection of the environment;</li>
<li>Safeguarding the interests of weaker sections of society including the handicapped and mentally retarded;</li>
<li>Promoting cultural, educational and aesthetic aspects;</li>
<li>Constructing and maintaining cattle pounds and preventing cruelty to animals;</li>
<li>Slum improvement and upgradation;</li>
<li>Urban poverty alleviation;</li>
<li>Providing urban amenities and facilities such as gardens, public parks and play grounds. (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to a recent report by the Confederation of Indian Industry,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cities  have narrow financial resource bases leading to monetary constraints.  Share of transfers from state governments in the revenues of  municipalities was 31.7 per cent on an average (2001/02). Municipalities  in several states are almost entirely transfer-dependent for running  local services. The dependence was as high as 84 per cent in case of  Jammu &amp; Kashmir, 83 percent in case of Rajasthan and 74 percent in  case of Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, the financial viability of municipal  corporations is dependent on the transfers from the State Governments.A  city’s own revenues are mostly dependent on octroi and property taxes.  Most urban districts have abolished octroi; property tax collections  suffer from evasion and low levels of collection efficiency.  Consequently, Indian cities are unable to commit requisite financial  resources for development (Exhibit 4.7). (3)</p></blockquote>
<p><span>I  am told that in the particular case of Vrindavan, the municipality has  found it extremely difficult to raise property tax over the years to  meet the town’s needs because the moneyed interests of temples and  ashrams have strongly resisted and even refused to pay higher taxes,  clinging to archaic codes and often paying little more than an ordinary  householder.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>The  present condition of Municipalities in India is very dismal in terms of  the wide gap between the functions to be performed and the available  resources for it. The studies instituted by the 11th Central Finance  Commission confirmed this fact across all the states. In spite of this,  the Commission declared an ad hoc award of Rs. 1600 crores for  Panchayats and only Rs. 400 crores for Municipalities. The amount is  less than half of what the earlier finance commission had awarded.  Nevertheless, the Commission recommended that there should be a separate  tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>An explanation of state transfers and the lack of  municipal revenue outside of property tax is offered by the Commonwealth  Human Rights Initiative:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Constitution, even after  the 74th Amendment does not provide for an independent set of taxes that  the Municipalities can raise. The Constitution has made it mandatory  for every state to constitute a State Finance Commission (SFC). The SFC  is to review the financial position of the Municipalities and make  recommendations regarding distribution of taxes between the States and  the Municipalities. It is also expected to look into the criteria for  grants-in-aid and suggest measures needed to improve the financial  position of the Municipalities. But the SFC has to function strictly  according to the terms of reference provided to it by the state.</p>
<p>Since  funds required and the functions to be performed are interrelated the  SFCs could review the existing situation and recommend a functional  domain that would serve public interest and also be financially viable.  But most of the SFCs did not touch on the subject at all. (4)</p></blockquote>
<p>By  1997, the Uttar Pradesh SFC recommended that Uttar Pradesh 7% of the  net proceeds of State’s total tax revenue should be transferred to urban  local bodies. According to the 2009-2010 UP budget, a little under 4%  of state revenue is being transferred to ULB’s, with an additional 2  percent allocated for specific projects like targeted city development  (such as funds allocated for the Braj projects), slum housing, latrines  and river pollution control. 200 crore is earmarked for interest-free  loans that municipalities could take out.(5)</p>
<p>The State Planning  Department points out that, “the financial position of ULBs in the State  continues to be precarious and they are often unable to meet  expenditure on salaries and other essential services like power dues. As  a result, the quality of urban services remains poor. Urgent steps are,  therefore, called to revamp the financial situation of ULBs. The fiscal  domain of these bodies needs to be expanded and they have to be  persuaded to take steps to raise revenue from their own resources.  Access of these bodies to institutional sources of funding and capital  market has to be improved.”(6) The Planning Department also reports that  the financial power of the Nagar Palika Parishad is limited to Rs.  50,000.</p>
<p>Both Human Rights Initiative and the Confederation of  Indian Industry point to a lack of manpower and organizational  infrastructure as well as (or as a consequence of) low revenues. From  the Confederation of Indian Industry report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Resource  constraints are not only financial but also capability driven. Planning  capabilities often do not match up to requirements. Consequently, city  development has mostly been short sighted and not holistic. Capacity to  execute has also traditionally been poor due to shortage of skilled  personnel. Our interviews with Municipal Commissioners and Mayors  clearly highlighted that he biggest limitation to project execution is  unavailability of skilled personnel. This is further exacerbated by the  use of archaic tools and processes. (7)</p></blockquote>
<p>Corruption and  fragmented accountability or overlapping areas of responsibility are  also cited as problems facing municipalities as urbanization trends  place more demands on them for infrastructure and services (See exhibit  E.1 below).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S_FtO-gRKMI/AAAAAAAABL8/VnE71bv7iUw/s1600/Doc7.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472275126295800002" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S_FtO-gRKMI/AAAAAAAABL8/VnE71bv7iUw/s400/Doc7.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>This  is yet another example of India having legislation in place (the  constitutional amendments), but not having a proper delineation of  detail and framework for accountability. It is therefore important that  we try to understand the position of the municipality and the  constraints under which it works. This tells us that the state is who we  really want to target when it comes to demanding better municipal  service, that property taxes should be increased for high revenue  institutions in town, and that NGO’s and public private partnerships  should be recognized as possible key participants in any plans for  improvement or change.</p>

<p>Lahti  (Finland): If there is will power and a clear vision, the now dying  Yamuna river in India can be saved, says an expert from Finland where  the once sewage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesijärvi">Lake Vesijärvi</a> now provides crystal clear water to people in this country.</p>

<p>Vesijärvi,  near the Finnish city of Lahti (pop. 100,000), was a sewage and  industrial wastewater dump 30 years ago, just like the Yamuna is for New  Delhi. In the 1980s, a campaign was launched to revitalise the entire  111-sq km stretch and improve the quality of water.</p>
<p>Today, it is  one of nearly 60,000 lakes, out of 180,000 that dot this Nordic country,  providing potable water to 5.3 million people.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A  similar campaign now aims to see the Yamuna &#8212; one of the most polluted  and toxic waterways in the world &#8212; regain its old glory by 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;To  clean the 22-km long stretch of Yamuna, the same miracle model of  Vesijärvi can be used,&#8221; said Kaj Jansson, vice president for research  and technology with Kemira, one of the world&#8217;s three leading water  chemical companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, much more than funds, it takes strong will power and a clear vision to save rivers,&#8221; Jansson told IANS.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So where do Finns see a possibility to clean the drainage called Yamuna?</p>
<p>&#8220;Finland  has the technology to clean rivers like Yamuna. New Delhi needs clean  water for its 16 million residents. So this expertise can certainly come  in handy,&#8221; said Nina Harjula, the development manager with the Lahti  Science and Business Park.</p>
<p>The park is home to the third largest  business incubator in Finland and coordinates the development of the  national Cleantech Cluster.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Heikki  Tallgren, managing director of Waterix, a market leader in Finland in  natural water aeration, said: &#8220;We can provide surface water areators  that works in cleaning natural bodies of water, for municipal and  industrial waste water treatment to the Indian government. Waterix is  also capable of providing tailor-made solutions which fit into the  customer&#8217;s process perfectly.</p>
<p>Said Jansson: &#8220;Indian Environment  Minister Jairam Ramesh has announced Rs.500 crore (82 million Euro) for  2010-11 for Ganga clean-up. Also, the government has spent over Rs.5,000  crore (820 million Euro) on cleaning the Yamuna till now.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Compared  to this, the lake Vesijärvi clean-up budget was minuscule. In the year  of the Commonwealth Games when the world will be looking at India, it is  probably the right time to look beyond the available means to provide  clean water to its billion-plus population,&#8221; added Jansson.</p>
<p>Kemira  and Finland&#8217;s Technical Research Centre VTT have recently announced the  setting up of a major water research centre to turn clean water into a  high-end industrial product.</p>

<p>PROPOSED BAN ON TRADE IN PEACOCK FEATHERS</p>
<p>10th May 2010. Delhi</p>
<p>The  Ministry of Environment and Forests, in response to numerous requests  from various stakeholders, is in the process of banning the trade of  peacock feathers. It has been brought to the Ministry’s attention that  the demand for the feathers outsrips the supply leading to the rampant  poaching and killing of the birds for the purpose of their feathers.</p>
<p>To  this end the Ministry proposes to amend Sections 43(3)(a) and 44 of the  Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which relate to the transfer and sale of  the tail feathers of peacocks. The proposed amendment is intended to  prevent the illegal trapping and killing of the national bird for their  tail feathers.</p>
<p>Currently, the Act prohibits the killing of  peacocks as well as export of tail feathers or articles made from them.  But, the Act allows domestic trade in feathers or articles under the  assumption that these are naturally shed.</p>
<p>Following the  amendment, section 43(3)(a) and section 44 will no longer exempt those  possessing a certificate of ownership for peacocks from transferring or  selling the tail feather and articles or trophies made from them. There  will be imposed a comprehensive ban on the sale, transfer and trade of  peacock feathers.</p>
<p>Comments are invited on the above.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nanda  Maharaj, Yasoda Ma, and many others decided to go on pilgrimage to take  bath in the Ganga. On the way they stopped to spend the night in  Govardhan. Krishna began to think, ” All of the holy rivers are present  here in My Braja, but alas the Brajabasis do not understand this. Let me  show them.” As soon as Krishna thought in this way Mother Ganga  appeared in person before Him and everyone else. The Brajabasis were  extremely surprised to see her there. Krishna told them, “All of the  holy rivers in the three worlds are present in Brajabhumi because they  wish to do the seva of Brajabhumi. Because you were all going to leave  Braja to bathe in the Ganga she has mercifully appeared before you,  therefore take your bath in her sacred waters. Henceforth this place  will be known as Manasi Ganga.” This took place during the night of the  new moon in Kartik Masa. Mother Ganga appeared from the mind of Sri  Krishna.</p></blockquote>
<p>(May 11) I went back to see how the cleaning  process was going and found that they are still working at it in full  force. A company from Delhi was hired to do the job and they brought in  many pieces of heavy equipment to remove all the sludge and gunk from  the bottom and haul it away.  From what I understand it is being dumped  somewhere between Govardhan and Radhakunda. They are predicting that  they will be finished in about two months.</p>
<p>Manasa Ganga has been  frightfully dirty for a long time. It is good to see that the central  government is taking this initiative. It appears that enough  consciousness raising has been done by Braja Foundation and other groups  in the Braj area to attract federal money.</p>

Minutes of the meeting of Braj-Vrindavan Heritage Alliance (BVHA)</p>
<p>Place: Vanshi Vat; 12th May 2010</p>
<p>Those  present: Shri Bhagawat Sharan Goutam, Shri Bal Krishna Goutam, Shri  Govind Kishor Goswami, Dr. Devendra Chaitanya Brahmachari, Shri  Jagadananda Das, Ms. Katie Walter, Acharya Naresh Narain, Shri Krishna  Gopal Gupta, Jagannath Poddar, Ms. Pratibha Sharma, Dr. Chandra Prakash  Sharma, Shri Suresh Vedpathi, Shri Gopal Ji, Shri Jagadananda Das, Shri  Madhumangal Shukla, Shri Ravindra Kulshreshtha, Shri Satyamurti  Saraswat, Shri Anand Bihari Sharma, Shri Gour Gopal Bharadwaj, Shri  Pradyumna Pratap Singh, Shri Kanhaiya Gupta, Shri Govind Sharan, Shri  Manatosh Pahari</p>
<p>Chair: Thakur Shri Vanshivat Bihari through His servant Shri Govind Sharan.</p>
<p>The following topics were discussed in the meeting &amp; unanimously resolved:</p>
<p>The  meeting began with the issue of the Kesi-Ghat proposed bridge. Some  newcomers argued about this issue, saying that they agree with all the  other issues of the BVHA to protect the swarup (original form) of the  holy town of Vrindavan. But their opinion differs on the issue of the  Kesi Ghat Bridge. They thought that the bridge was essential keeping in  mind the traffic congestion, parikrama and the growing number of  tourists coming to Vrindavan.</p>
<p>It was clarified to the newcomers  by the senior members of the BVHA that Kesi Ghat is the only ghat left  where the Yamuna touches (even if it is sewer water) the ghat. Under no  circumstances the construction of bridge is acceptable. The bridge will  only help to deteriorate the swarup of Vrindavan.  The actual Parikrama  marg was inside the town where the devotees used to visit the temples  while doing Parikrama and then coming out to the ghats by the side of  Yamuna. Moreover twenty six pillars on Yamuna is not acceptable.</p>
<p>The  bridge should be built across the river in Sunrakh or near Kalidah  keeping the growing population in mind. Vrindavan should be kept in the  form of a peninsula.</p>
<p>It was also decided that a form containing  the issues of BVHA be signed by those who are interested to be a member  of the alliance. Those who support the bridge are not welcome in the  BVHA meetings.</p>
<p>It was also decided to make a Tulsi Van in Vanshi  Vat. Some typical Braj trees will also be planted where ever there is a  scope to plant in the Vanshi Vat temple campus.</p>

<hr />
Goa&#8217;s  Chief Minister Digambar Kamath came with his family to Mathura and  Vrindavan on Thursday. In Mathura, Mr. Kamath went to attend the yearly  festival at the Ramaayan Pracharini Sabha. He also visited the  Dwarkadhish temple and the Krishna Janma Bhumi for darshan. In  Vrindavan, he  visited several temples including Iskcon, where he danced  with the devotees, and Banke Bihariji.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/2008/01/17/images/2008011759870101.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img src="http://www.thehindu.com/2008/01/17/images/2008011759870101.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Though  on a personal pilgrimage, he agreed to give informal press conferences  in both towns before leaving. He refused to discuss politics but only  spoke on religious matters to journalists, praising the path of devotion  and love. A person may be from anywhere in the world, but if he comes  to Vrindavan, he will not be bereft of bhakti.</p>
<p>He said that  Mathura and Vrindavan have not changed much in ten years, when he came  the last time for a visit. He said that the beautification of all  religious sites throughout Vrindavan and Braj is a necessity.</p>
<p>In  his opinion, development in the land of Krishna&#8217;s birth is insufficient,  but he promised to put his own personal influence and contacts to use  for helping increase such development.</p>
<p>He said that he has given a  great deal of cooperation in the development of other religious sites  like Pandharpur (in Maharashtra) and could do the same here. In fact, he  seeks a kind of close relationship between beautiful scenic Goa and  Krishna&#8217;s birthplace. Both would benefit from it.</p>
<p>He said that in  Goa also, the number of temples is increasing. Many tourists visit Goa  and it has become an important tourist center for Indians as well as  foreigners. The federal and state governments have vowed to protect the  area.</p>
<p>He observed that the broken streets in Vrindavan must be a source of great vexation to the faithful.</p>
<p>By  way of contrast, he gave the example of Shirdi in Maharashtra, which  has made great forward strides. Ten years ago there was absolutely  nothing, but the development that has taken place over this time is  really worth seeing. The Maharashtra government has invested a great  deal there, providing many facilities for pilgrims. Everyone who goes  there is very impressed with their visit.</p>
<hr />
Comments: This  shows several things. One is that people notice that Vrindavan is not  living up to its potential and that the mess in the streets is the first  thing that they notice. This is not good because it makes everyone&#8217;s  focus the damn cars. And this makes the city and development authorities  concentrate all their energies on streets rather than finding other  ways to improve the city. All the problems that we are facing are due to  accomodation for cars above everything else.</p>
<p>Two, people like  Kamath, from a faroff state like Goa, are ready and willing to help. The  idea of a Goa-Vrindavan axis of some sort sounds interesting. But  Vrindavan would need to be brought up to snuff. It could be a kind of  Jaipur with its beautiful old buildings and temples, if only these are  brought into their best light. And, obviously, if the garden-forest mood  of Vrindavan can somehow be revived.</p>
<p>Three, they mostly have no  idea what they are talking about. Shirdi and Vrindavan cannot be  compared in any way, as Shirdi is a new place. You can build highways,  parking lots, hotels, etc., with little or no negative impact on local  heritage or environment. Vrindavan is a far more complex and delicate  situation. People like Kamath need to be educated, but they are no doubt  open to such education.</p>
<p>The man is obviously pious and such  people need to be engaged in any way possible, as donors, advisors,  well-wishers. Let us wish him the best and hope that someone with vision  takes him up on his offer.</p>
<p>Radhe Radhe.</p></div>

<span>Project: Kishor Van</span></p>
<p><span>A Pilot Project for Rehabilitating Environmental Heritage through Sacred Groves Conservation and Revival Project in Vrindavan</span></p>
<p>Background:  Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh’s connection with nature stretches back for  thousands of years. It is a pilgrimage town due to its association with  the Hindu god Krishna, who worshipped the trees, mountains, rivers and  animals while teaching his family, friends and devotees to do the same.  Vrindavan’s very name is derived from the words, “vrinda,” meaning the  tulsi or sacred basil tree (as well as its form as a revered goddess)  and “van,” meaning forest.</p>
<p>The whole town of Vrindavan, as well  as the rest of the Braj region of which it is a part, once contained  large areas of sacred forests and groves. Today, thoughtless development  and mismanagement has caused these sacred green spaces to dwindle down  to the bare minimum: only a handful of specific spaces and trees remain,  and even these have been ravaged by water shortages and a population of  monkeys that is too large for the town to sustain.</p>
<p><strong>The Sacred Groves Conservation and  Revival Project</strong> aims to save these last bastions of environmental heritage in Vrindavan  and use the experience as a pilot project for greater efforts  throughout Braj.</p>
<p>In the Indian public imagination, Vrindavan is  an idyllic small town set within a majestic forest near the pristine  River Yamuna with green pastures for grazing cattle nearby. This scene  serves as the backdrop for stories about young Krishna, who played and  accomplished numerous heroic feats here. The popular stories of  Krishna’s youth are even being aired as a cartoon series that ranks  second most watched on India’s top children’s channel.</p>
<p>This  image originally put forth in the Bhagavat Puurana and the timeless  devotional poetry and literature of such great figures as Surdas, Rupa  Goswami and Jayadev is still what comes to mind for many when Vrindavan  is mentioned. Additionally, due to its legendary status as a dham, or  dwelling place of Lord Krishna, Vrindavan is an important centre for  pilgrimage. Pilgrims have come here for centuries to experience an  environmental ambience that will inspire devotional ecstasy and  recollection of Lord Krishna’s life in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>However, what  people see when they visit Vrindavan today is a concrete maze of  overcrowded streets filled with garbage. Sadly, there is nothing that  would constitute a forest here. There are only a few trees, and these  face the danger of getting chopped down as the town rushes to expand  without considering consequences to the environment and its heritage  role in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Streets are widened and new properties are  constructed, bringing in more people, which in turn means yet more cars,  more garbage, less green space and less water. Pilgrimage feeds  economic growth and economic growth feeds pilgrimage, but the course of  economic growth here is unwieldy and threatens to destroy the very  heritage that makes Vrindavan a place worth coming to.</p>
<p>This rapid  depletion and destruction of the environment is severing a vital link  between the people and the religio-cultural significance of the area. By  reestablishing this link, the Sacred Groves Conservation and Revival  Project can raise awareness among the public at large regarding  conservation of sacred groves and environmental heritage.</p>
<p>The  kunds, forests and River Yamuna are the core of environmental heritage  for Braj-Vrindavan and all of them are under sustained attack. The  kunds, both sacred sites and traditional rainwater harvesting  catchments, are silted and going dry; the forests and groves are  vanishing, and the Yamuna River is a waste canal that serves as a  breeding ground for disease.  These aspects of the sacred geography of  Braj, which make Vrindavan and its surrounding area what it is to  millions of people all over the world, will soon become ruined  completely if efforts are not taken.</p>
<h3>Sacred Groves Conservation and Revival Project</h3>
<p>A  rehabilitation of environmental heritage and a hope for future:  Heritage is the cultural legacy that we inherit from our past and pass  on to the future. Indian heritage is unique in its respect for all  nature and belief that every organism on earth has a special role in  life’s cycle. There is a reverence for Mother Nature in all her  manifestations which is evident in the traditions, rituals and practices  that permeate every aspect of life, and this is especially true in  Braj.</p>
<p>In Braj and many other parts of India (and indeed  throughout the world) Krishna serves as a vital link between people,  their ecology and environment. Sacred scriptures contain numerous  examples of how nature and ecology were powerful elements during  Krishna’s life and times. In Shrimad Bhawatam Krishna tells his father,  “The cities, the cultured lands nor the villages or their houses are  ours. We are the forest people, dear father, and will always live in the  forests and the hills”.</p>
<p>This is the heritage that will be  rehabilitated through our efforts. People will be trained to protect the  existing groves, gardens and forests of Braj and thus reconnect with a  cultural identity that has been lost to the pursuit of quick money  gained though theme tourism. Tourism and pilgrimage both will vanish  along with the groves as the rush for growth continues. Now is the time  to reverse this process to make people see that conservation can be more  profitable than destruction, especially in the long run.</p>
<h3>Kishore Van: a pilot project for the sacred grove conservation</h3>
<div>The  choice of Kishor Van as a starting point for the Sacred Groves  Conservation and Revival Project is an obvious one. Only three of the  many sacred groves of Vrindavan are still in existence today. These are  Nidhivan, Seva Kunj and Kishore Van. Kishore Van is the smallest of the  three and thus a good place to begin our efforts.</p>
<p>Krishna’s past  in evidence is in real danger of disappearing and Kishor Van, along with  the other two remaining groves of Vrindvan, is one of the few remaining  legacies from Vrindavan’s past. It is here that Krishna is believed to  have danced with his gopis and many consorts and played his flute for  them. Many people believe that Krishna still comes to these groves every  night to dance and play, which is why nobody is allowed to enter these  groves to after sundown lest they disturb the divine activities.</p>
<p>At  present, Vrindavan’s groves have only scattered patches of stunted  shrubbery. The Sacred Groves Conservation and Revival Project aims to  restore these groves to the glory they possess in sacred texts and the  popular imagination by accomplishing the objectives outlined below.</p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>

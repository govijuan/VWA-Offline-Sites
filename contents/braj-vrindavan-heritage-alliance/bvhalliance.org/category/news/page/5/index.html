<p><strong>Meeting Summary</strong><br />
*Kanika Prasad Goswami &#8211; Radha Damodhar Mandir<br />
-One of the biggest problems in Vrindavan is the problem of water.  Water is the most important thing in our lives. We should discuss what to do in order to clean the waters of the Yamuna.</p>
<p>*Paramadvaiti Swami &#8211; Vrinda Kunja<br />
-We can identify two major problems: one is that water is very dirty and we are constantly polluting it.  Another is that 10 years from now in Vrindavan waters will be dried.  On one side we are putting poison in the water and on the other it is going to finish.  So, we must do something very serious as soon as possible.</p>
<p>*Madhu Mangal Sukla<br />
-We must solve the problems with the monkeys, because due to them we can not care for the trees either. They destroy everything.</p>
<p>*Pradyumna Goswami &#8211; Mirabai Mandir<br />
I have seen the ancient temples of Vrindavan, formerly the ashrams have large green areas. Each time anyone goes to build a new building in Vrindavan they must show a plan or a demo of what they will do.</p>
<p>*Paramadvaiti Swami &#8211; Vrinda Kunja<br />
-Sewak Sharan made &#8211; many years ago &#8211; a master plan for Vrindavan, where Chatikara road whole is a green area completely protected.  Green areas mean water protection. Vrindavan is in a similar situation as a little baby monkey who must be protected by the mother and the other monkeys.  We ought to get even angry against things which are damaging Vrindavan, we must raise our voices &#8230; otherwise we can not achieve anything.<br />
-This is the meeting 40th of the BVHAlliance.  Before we have seen some developments, but we must be more functional.  We must clearly identify what issues are incumbent upon us in order to help Vrindavan.  If people do not come to these meetings, then we ask signatures to have more support and present them before the NGOs and the government.<br />
-The most important of all is personal activism; different organizations should individually do their part, and together make more pressure.  To do this we have some forms that allow people to subscribe and more actively participate.<br />
-Many people are encouraged to help, but they do not know how to do it. That is why we have committees that allow people to help on specific topics.<br />
-The Environmental Committee of the WVA started a program called &#8220;Helping Hands&#8221; that seeks to secure funding for solve economic problems of Vrindavan.  Thus we can generate work for Brijvasis as well as cleaning specific areas and provide specific solutions.<br />
-We must be activists in cleaning our land and taking care for our water.<br />
-Our meetings are to report on progress, get materials, but the practical work depends on what each of us makes in his ashram.<br />
-We do not need to build more buildings in Vrindavan, we need more trees instead.</p>
<p>*Lokesh prabhu &#8211; Journalist of New York Times<br />
-To return to Vrindavan from the outside I realized that the problems of Vrindavan were generated by ourselves.<br />
-We must take more initiative to provide solutions<br />
-Unless we make an effort to turn our dreams into reality, then nothing will happen.<br />
-We must have the desire and energy to change this into reality.</p>
<p>*Baba Madan Bihari Das &#8211; Tathisthan<br />
-We must become stricter in our cause<br />
-We must abolish all plastics in the Ashrams; in Tathiesthan they do not use any plastic.<br />
-We must win the backing of the Mahantas of the 300 temples of Vrindavan to our cause. I personally am going to do it.<br />
-The government is not looking at sites for reforestation, they are looking for more parking places, they do not want to restore or protect the places, and they just want to bring more people.<br />
-The use of plastics is very dangerous for our lives. We must abstain completely from its use within the Ashrams<br />
-We should go talk to the office of the 4 sampradayas, because we all somehow belong to it and they can get much support.  They should help us. Our next meeting we should realize it there.</p>
<p>*Parthasarathi Prabhu &#8211; Food for Life Vrindavan<br />
-We must do everything to warn people about what is happening. We must do all these problems something public.<br />
-The government has its own way, they never consulted us what to do, they are trying to develop Vrindavan, but in a material way, not spiritual.<br />
-The most important thing is that people are informed to bring as many people to our BVHAlliance&#8217;s meetings. They do not know what is happening and should know.</p>
<p>*Arcana Dasi<br />
-We must be careful not to just talk and talk, but to get into action.<br />
-I propose the idea of going to different groups of people and educate them on all these issues. For example, we assembled a group of riksheros, we share a good prasadam with them and later we introduce them to everything that is happening and the possible solutions. The same with widows, schools, etc.<br />
-In the same way we must create awareness in the government, with the help of people representing each mandir, even if the government does not want to listen we should have the support of the people.<br />
-Each Ashram should commit to eliminate plastic inside the temple and spread to all its devotees about the bad of the use of plastic.<br />
-We must make standard posters for hanging. In Cloth.</p>
<p>*Lokesh Prabhu &#8211; Journalist of New York Times<br />
-We must define what kind of letters we want to send to the government. We should identify a type of letter to the government and other letters to people.<br />
-For the government and the bureaucratic system really pay attention to our requests we must seek the support of skilled and professional people in the area, otherwise they do not know who we are and what we do.<br />
-We should perform two types of pressure: one is to get the support of all people and the other is to press the government with important people who can support our requests.</p>
<p>Agreements:<br />
-We will write 3 types of cards to alert the community and the government of what is happening and each solution.<br />
-Letter about to abolish the use of plastics in the ashrams is to be written by Baba Bihari Das Madan, will add the issue of banning the burning of plastic waste is highly polluting.<br />
-Letter on control of the buildings in the city will be written by Parthasarathi prabhu<br />
-Letter &#8211; request for a land for basic water purification is pending.<br />
-Every time an ashram decide to be against plastic, it is committed to spread it within its own ashram. Put posters to be designed for it.<br />
-Vrinda Kunja-takes over the design of the poster which will be printed on canvas.<br />
-The BVHAlliance has three offices available for outreach and awareness. One in Brahma Kunda, one in Pandavali Kunja (in Keshighat) and in Yamuna Kunja.<br />
-It will be distributed participation questionnaires to all ashrams and thus to establish a link to more people.<br />
-Baba Madan Bihari Das and Kanika Prasad Goswami will go to the office of 4 sampradayas to link to our work and to schedule the next meeting there.</p>

Meeting of Organization Committee, November 14th, 2010 – Vrinda Kunja, Vrindavan</p>
<p>Present<br />
Devendra Chaitanya Maharaj, Jagannath Poddar, BrajRaj (Neeraj), Rajveer Singh (judge), BV Vishnu Maharaj, BA Paramadvaiti Maharaj, Narasimha Maharaj, Arup Govinda Das, Vishnupada Das, Pancatattwa Das, Damodar Lila dd, Gandharvika dd.</p>
<p>Report meeting 14.11.10<br />
- It was a meeting of a small group, the Organizational Committee. Next Sunday the decisions taken in this meeting will be presented for official approval of the amplified BVHA meeting / ‘assembly’.</p>
<p>Topics:<br />
-	Various:<br />
o	News about the bridge building? Some say that the building would start in January 2011 after finishing the road construction, some say that there won’t come a bridge anymore… There is no clear news about the current situation and position of the government.<br />
o	Currently they are drilling to make drains and by doing so damaging and killing trees in Vrindavan. We need to document Vrindavan’s situation for the Court case about the half circular bridge, drains, tree cutting, cars etc. (Jagannath Poddar)<br />
o	 “For now, we do not have the support of the government in our efforts to clean up Vrindavan and Yamuna. For now it is running on civic initiative and donations.” (Jagannath Poddar)<br />
o	Vrindavan is a top devotion city in India and even over the world; there are many people who are caring &amp; ready to help only if they would know how to.</p>
<p>-	Decisions concerning BVHA organization, that will be presented on the general BVHA meeting :<br />
o	Official office address for BVHA: Mungeer Mandir (Saddhu Maharaj was called on the phone, he agreed but needed to think a day about it…)<br />
o	Rotation of places and president of meetings: the meetings will be held each time in a different place, presided by someone from that place.<br />
o	Instalment of different committees within BVHA, and coordinators/chairmen per committee. Important in the nomination of the coordinator, is not only the knowledge, but definitely also the caring they have for Vrindavan and the committee topic. Each committee should have a first meeting in which its own organization, methods, funds and relevant topics are discussed.</p>
<p>*	Interim Secretary of the BVHA office (until approved by ‘assembly’)<br />
Devendra Chaitanya Maharaj<br />
- The Secretary is a volunteer, unpaid.<br />
- Devendra Maharaj is someone who cares for the cause, who is a good communicator in Hindi &amp; English (journalist background), who has good connections with the local people &amp; spiritual leaders, he runs an ashram (which makes it easier to get things done from ashram leaders), and he can start by setting a good example of what a Secretary of the BVHA should do. He will give at least 3 times a week some hours of his time for this Secretary service.<br />
- The Secretary will get assistance of a paid employee, who needs to be looked for and hired. ‘Friends of Vrindavan’ engaged to give 1.000 Rupies / month for the employee’s salary.<br />
- While this Assistant secretary is not yet in place, Vishnu das will be some hours per day at the Secretary’s disposal.</p>

<p>*	Clean Vrindavan Committee<br />
- Coordinator: Rajveer Singh<br />
-  Assistants: Vishnu das (Vrinda Kunja); also Neeraj and Jagannath Poddar should make part of this committee.<br />
- If we want the support of the municipality, we need to strive for a clean Vrindavan, not only for a clean Yamuna as this does not really interest them.</p>

<p>*	Clean Yamuna Committee<br />
-  Vishnu das is, on behalf of Vrinda Kunja, in charge of cleaning the Yamuna side, doing this free of charge.</p>
<p>*	Communication with Municipality<br />
Coordinator: Rajveer Singh</p>
<p>*	Public Relations Committee<br />
- Proposal Coordinator: Manju Sarma<br />
- This committee is different from press committee. Idea is to go from temple to temple, try to convince them and make them sign petitions.<br />

<p>*	Press Committee<br />
In charge: Devendra Chaitanya Maharaj &amp; Madhu Mangal Sukla</p>

<p>*	Yamuna Ghats Committee<br />

<p>*	Heritage Tours Committee<br />
- In charge taking around people on these tours: Ram Narayan Brijbasi<br />

In charge: Vishnu Das</p>
<p>*	International Relations &amp; website (VrindavanToday &amp; BVHA):<br />
- Secretaries: Katie Walter, Damodar Lila dd<br />
- Website: Gandharvika dd</p>
<p>*	Monkey Issue Committee?<br />
The municipality is not willing to do anything about this situation, and it would be quite complicated (court orders…), so it is decided to leave it like this, no committee is being created (for now).</p>
<p>To do (internally):<br />
-	Put an article about this meeting &amp; info on website:</p>
<p>http://www.news.vrindavantoday.org</p>
<p>http://bvhalliance.org/</p>
<p>-	Call for volunteers (&amp; what will they do?)  put on website<br />
-	Make a Vrindavan facebook<br />
-	What will we do when our demands are not met?</p>

The trip is not without  difficulties, as the flyover crossing the railroad tracks at Chattikara  is being done with maximum inconvenience to everyone. Why they cannot  leave some kind of facility for vehicle traffic while the overpass is  being built is beyond me. Tempos and other vehicles leave you at the  Mathura-Agra highway and make you walk the 200 meters or so up to the  railroad tracks, where you have to climb under the gates, cross the  tracks and then another 50 meters or so to find your next mode of  transport. Evidently, people are accustomed to being taken for granted  and their needs ignored.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.news.vrindavantoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Radha-Kund.jpg"><img title="Radha Kund before the samskara" src="http://www.news.vrindavantoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Radha-Kund-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" /></a>At  any rate, after visiting with a friend in the Radha Kund village, I  made my way to the Kund itself. I was delighted by the results of the  samskara efforts. I wish I had not lost my camera, as I would like to  show everyone just how nice it looks. The three kunds&#8211;Radha, Shyam and  Lalita&#8211;are all clad in decorated pink sandstone. Many of the entrance  points to the kunds have also been given nicely made gates of the same  material. The buildings that are at the confluence of the kunds have  also been beautified, giving an overall positive impression.</p>
<p>There  is no doubt in my mind that Radha Kund is one of the most powerful  spiritual points I have ever been to. Radha&#8217;s name immediately came to  my throat and a feeling that I had come to my true spiritual home.</p>
<p>It was 3 in the afternoon on a fairly ordinary day, which may have explained it, but there was an overall atmosphere of peace.</p>
<p>After  visiting the Krishna Chaitanya Shastra Mandir, I started on my way  around the parikrama marg. The new road is nicely made, but even at 3 in  the afternoon, a number of cars came honking by, filled with tourists  doing their car parikrama.</p>
<p>As I have done each of the last few  times I have gone to Radha Kund, I stopped at the Panchayat offices in  the Raj Bari and talked to the people there about stopping car  parikrama.</p>
<p>It would be a fairly easy thing to place a gate at the  entrance way to the parikrama path and to oblige all people to go  around the Kundas on foot. It is only a few hundred meters at most, even  the the old and invalid could do it.</p>
<p>What I stressed to the  people in the Panchayat office was the same as what we are saying in the  BVHA: By promoting vehicle traffic, the local people suffer. No one  will spend money locally if they are just speeding through.</p>
<p>Besides,  those who are in vehicles ruin the atmosphere for everyone else. The  beautiful peaceful and spiritually charged atmosphere is immediately  ruined by people in cars who push their way through the pilgrims&#8211;many  of whom do the parikrama lying down. When the spiritual atmosphere is  ruined, then Radha Kund&#8217;s principal wealth is lost.</p>
<p>As I  continued on my way, when the next cars came by, I stopped them in a  crusading spirit and spoke to the driver. &#8220;Do you think you are getting  any spiritual benefit,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;by driving around the Kunds? All the  shastras say to do parikrama barefoot. They say it is an offense to  enter the temple in a palanquin or vehicle. And yet you do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not  only that, but you commit offenses to the pilgrims who are here. Piety  is to help someone remember Krishna, but you make people forget Krishna  by honking your horn. Do you not think that you are committing an  offense to the devotees?&#8221;</p>
<p>The driver looked a bit helpless, as  his main passenger was obviously his guru, an elderly sadhu dressed in  orange. The sadhu did not look at me, but straight ahead. The driver  indicated that the sadhu was old and infirm and could not walk. I said  that they should make arrangements, bringing a wheelchair so that he  could also better enjoy the parikrama. But as a senior sadhu, he should  set the proper example for others, especially his disciples.</p>
<p>All  too often, I see that sadhus in their vehicles, cars or motorcycles,  become just as inconsiderate of others as ordinary non-devotees.If  anyone, they should set the example.</p>
<p>Further on, I encountered a  cluster of pandas drinking tea. I approached them and asked them why  they don&#8217;t pressure the town council to block the road and only allow  local traffic in. I said, &#8220;No one will pay you one cent of pranami if  they never get out of their cars. Your business will be better if they  get down and walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandas complained that they had no power.  That the rich rule the world and so on. I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish. You  are the owners of the Kund. If you and the babajis worked together on  this instead of always fighting, you might be able to accomplish  wonders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afterwards, I met with my old friend Lakshman Brajvasi,  who is building a guest house behind his own home. We talked for a  while about these things and the BVHA, whose goals he eagerly supports.  In Gaur Dham Colony, I also met with several babaji residents, all of  whom fervently support my ideas. We laughed about the new fashion of  doing helicopter parikrama around Govardhan. The point I tried to make  is that much of the Govardhan parikrama has been ruined by turning it  into a thoroughfare for vehicle traffic. But at least we should keep  Radha Kund sacred and make everyone walk around it.</p>
<p>The  bhajananandi Vaishnavas are the ones who are the worst affected by the  desecration of the holy places. And it is they who should be first on  the list of protected species. A society that only thinks of economic  advancement loses all sense of true value.</p>
<p>“The idea of a society  only held together by the relations and feelings arising out of  pecuniary interests is essentially repulsive.” (John Stuart Mill)</p>
<p>(I could not find any recent photos of the Kunds online. The most recent seem to be of the samskara itself last year.)</p>

<p><strong>The following points were discussed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shri  Ramesh Chandra Sharma, Regional Officer of the Archaeological Survey of  India, presented a detailed report on what steps have been taken on the  restoration of ASI-protected monuments of Shri Jugal Kishor, Govinda  Dev, Radha Ballabh and Madan Mohan Temples. He said that 96 notices have  been served to the people who have illegally done construction work  around these temples in their houses. Unfortunately they did not take  cognizance of any of these FIRs. However, the Director General of ASI  does have powers to get the illegal structures demolished through the  district administration, which in the first place should have stopped  then being constructed.</li>
<li>It was suggested that the ASI  should work closely with the owners of the ancient temples, ghats and  buildings having archaeological importance to conserve the heritage  buildings. <strong>It is not necessary that ASI acquire those buildings</strong> but it can always provide its technical support to restore them taking the owners into the confidence.</li>
<li>The  proposed &#8220;ropeway&#8221; (overhead cable car from Jaint village to Banke  Bihari) is completely irrelevant in Vrindavan’s case as it is not  situated in hilly area. Moreover the ropeway will leave a negative  impact on Vrindavan’s economy and will be beneficial for just one  temple. The Right to Information will be sent to the concerned  departments finding more details about it.</li>
<li>The meeting’s  chair Shri Nirmal Chandra Goswami suggested that a separate federation  of the temple trusts be formed under the aegis of the BVHA.</li>
<li>It was decided that Shri Jayant Chowdhry, Member of Parliament from Mathura should be invited to the next BVHA meeting.</li>
<li>Jagannath Poddar was asked to continue to convene the meetings and follow up the minutes of the meeting.</li>

<p>Uttar Pradesh (UP)  chief minister Mayawati’s Rs2,250-crore dream project —  the Yamuna  Expressway connecting Delhi and Agra — is in for a bumpy ride. The   Supreme Court (SC) raised certain pertinent queries on Friday regarding  its  environment clearance after 4,000 trees were chopped in the  vicinity of the Taj  Mahal.</p>
<p>The project envisages a six-lane,  165-km stretch connecting Greater Noida and  Agra and reduces travel  time between the cities from four to around two  hours.</p>
<p>The state  government had announced that it would complete the project by   February, but with SC stepping in it now appears a distant dream.</p>
<p>SC,  which  is seized of clearance to many projects since the 1990s in the  eco-sensitive  zone near the Taj Mahal, also called Taj Trapezium Zone  (TTZ), said the  clearance to the expressway had been given without its  consent. “Which authority  has permitted you? Even before touching TTZ,  you have to seek permission of this  court,” an anguished bench of  justices DK Jain and HL Dattu said.</p>
<p>The court also asked the  government-controlled Yamuna Expressway Authority  and Jaypee Infratech  Limited, which is building the expressway and real estates  along it, to  submit documents relating to environment clearance.</p>
<p>“We want to  see how you have been granted permission,” the court said while  putting  in abeyance a plea of the authorities concerned for permission to chop   more trees.</p>
<p>“You have put the cart before the horse,” the judges  saidand pointed out that  other aspects of environment, particularly  protection of the Taj Mahal and other  monuments in TTZ, had to be  considered before giving any clearance to the  project.</p>
<p>“We have  to see whether the project is prejudicial to the monuments or not,”  SC  said while taking note of a submission made by Krishan Mahajan, who is   assisting the court in this matter, that there were five protected  Mughal-era  monuments in the area.</p>
<p>A report submitted to the  court in 2008 had said 2,332 trees were illegally  felled around the Taj  Mahal, rendering the white marbled monument vulnerable to   environmental hazards.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance</h3>
<p>A meeting of the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance was held in the Krishna Chandrama Temple (Lala Babu) on August 1, 2010.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TFV1ODXQVYI/AAAAAAAAB3o/pUIw6Yhl3XA/s1600/lala+babu+a.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TFV1ODXQVYI/AAAAAAAAB3o/pUIw6Yhl3XA/s400/lala+babu+a.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></div>
<p>Chair: Thakur Shri Krishna Chandrama through His servant Shri Vasudev Goswami</p>
<p>The following points were discussed in the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>There  should be one comprehensive master plan for whole Braj region for  developmental point of view.  The development should be inclined to the  conservation and restoration rather than destructive unplanned  development. The planning should be done in consultation with the  intellectual, business, social and devotional community of Vrindavan.  The developmental package of Rs. 250 crore given by the government has  brought ten times more destruction for Vrindavan than actual  development.</li>
<li>The agricultural land of Braj should not  be allowed for the building of new colonies. The real estate business  should be discouraged. A Right to Information will be sent to enquire  the details of the land use in the Mathura District.  Vrindavan is named  after a <em>van</em> (forest), not a <em>pur</em> (town). Hence all effort should be done to save natural and built heritage of the place.</li>
<li>Multistoried  building should be banned for construction in the Braj area. A letter  showing this concern will be sent to the government. The elected public  representatives will be approached to address the issues in their  respective assemblies. A delegation will soon meet the Central and State  Government to declare Braj as Eco Sensitive Zone and Vrindavan as a  Pilgrimage Town. The speakers showed their concern on the unplanned  making of the drainage system in the town which will only invite to the  water logging and the diseases. When they are uncovered it may invite  the untimely death for the people who live in the town and the visitors  who come here with their ardent devotion.</li>
</ul>

Along with the huge  Muriya Poona Mela in Govardhan, a major event in Mathura has been the  several days of festivities at the huge 150 acre campus of the Jai  Gurudev Ashram on the Agra-Delhi Highway. The newspapers carried  succinct summaries of Baba Jai Gurudev&#8217;s lectures and I thought that it  would be interesting to translate them here as this ashram is a major  presence in Mathura.</p>
<p>Jaigurudev Baba belongs to the a tradition  of north Indian saints who are generally classified as Sant Mat. They  include Kabir, Ravi Das, Nanak, Dadu and many others. In the more recent  times Sant Kirpal Singh and the Radha Soami sect based in Beas, and in  the West, the Eckankar sect, are all prominent representatives. Some of  the their principal ideas can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_Shabd_Yoga">Surat Shabd Yoga</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Mat">Sant Mat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Sant_Mat_movements">Contemporary Sant Mat Movements</a>, etc. This article will give some idea of what he teaches, but I make no guarantees of accuracy.</em></p>

<h3>The Guru is not hungry for your money</h3>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TEoyDGUOduI/AAAAAAAABx4/KphH56fx_sE/s1600/jaygurudev.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/TEoyDGUOduI/AAAAAAAABx4/KphH56fx_sE/s400/jaygurudev.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></div>
<p>Sant  Baba Jaigurudev Maharaj said that there is no worship without the guru.  And at the same time, if you have done puja of the guru, you can say  that you have done all the necessary puja. Just like all rivers flow  into the sea, all worship culminates in the worship of the guru. One who  does even a moment’s devotion to the guru can easily cross over the  ocean of material suffering.</p>
<p>Sant Baba has been lecturing over  the past few days at the Jayguru Ashram on the Mathura-Agra Road in  Mathura. This is the biggest annual festival of the year and many  thousands of disciples and admirers come from all around the world on  this occasion.</p>
<p>He said that the glories of the guru are  unlimited and that no one can fully describe them. The guru has no need  or desire for the disciple’s money. One who has proper understanding  spends his money in the service of the guru and gets benefited from it  in that way. When the soul rises through sadhana then one will see the  guru in his own image.</p>
<p>The Sant said that when one gets older  then he becomes like an old ox. No one binds an old ox, so similarly  there are no restrictions on the old. This is the influence of time. So  do everything while you are young and it will be better for you. The  human body is a rare gift and it should be used for worshiping God.</p>

<em>Baba  Jaygurudev’s real name is Tulasi Das. His guru’s name was Ghurelal Ji  from Chirauli village in Aligarh district. Baba lived with him for many  years. His guru then told him to establish an ashram in a secluded place  in Mathura city to serve the poor. </em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>This he did in 1953 after the death of his guru. The first ashram was in Krishnanagar called Chirauli Sant Ashram. </em><em>Later  on in 1962 Baba Jaigurudev he purchased the 150 acre property on which  the present ashram is built. Because he remembers his gurudeva’s name  with every single thing that he does, he became known as Baba  Jaygurudev. Very few people know him by his original name Tulasi Das.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em><span><em>One of his significant ventures was the beginning of a political party, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshi_Party">Doordarshi Party</a>,  which contested a couple of general elections in the 1980’s on a  message of social reform and social uplift, with little success.</em></span></em></p>

<span>Separation in Sadhana</span></p>
<p>Baba  Jaigurudev said that the Surat or spirit is the divine realm. There are  no subdivisions or ingredients there: it is pure, permanent, undivided,  and single. Within it 44,000 candles burn. No one can describe its  beauty, only some indication can be given.  The sadhak who recognizes  the signs and takes up the path can reach this supreme abode. One who  does not recognize the signs will never get there.</p>
<p>Many pilgrims  have come to the Guru’s ashram to garner merit at the time of the Guru  Purnima. In his lecture, Baba Jaigurudeva said that when the Surat first  comes into the world, then first it takes on the names and forms, and  then slowly the veil of karma falls over it. Karma takes over the mind,  intelligence, and chitta.</p>
<p>You should relax your materialistic  activities somewhat. Whatever you do, do it with industry and honesty.  This is the way to get the grace of the sadhus. Always chant japa of the  Name. Keep on doing sadhana until the Holy Sound manifests itself. When  the Holy Sound manifests then your mind, intelligence and chitta, and  your spirit, will all be cleansed.</p>
<p>Baba said that the suffering  of separation in sadhana makes a devotee feel as though the entire world  is empty. Everything seems to be inadequate. The great souls cried and  lamented and by so doing crossed into the True Land. No trace of  material conditioning is left on them.</p>
<p>He said that the material  nature merges into earth, earth into water, water into fire, fire into  air, air into ether, ether into Maya, Maya into Ishwar, Ishwar into  Brahma, Brahma into the Para Brahma and Para Brahma into the Mahakala  Purusha or great form of time. And when he so wishes, this entire  creation expands outward again.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Give the treasure trove of your breath to others, says Sant Jaigurudev</h3>
<p>Baba  Jaigurudev said in a lecture yesterday that great souls come and do  their work in the world. Then when they leave, whatever breath they  leave behind they pass on as a gift to others. And when the time comes  that energy is activated.</p>
<p>On Sunday, during the Guru Puja, Baba  spoke to the assembly of devotees. He said that the external worship of  the guru can be seen with the two physical eyes, but the true puja is  seen with the third eye. When you look toward the guru with your inner  vision, then you will see that all around him there is only light. When  the guru is in the assembly, you can see above and below him. But in  fact, the guru is in the divine realm of Sat Loka. In fact, the genuine  guru is the one who is present throughout the world as Sat Loka.</p>
<p>Sadhana  is only the external cause. In fact, everything is being done by grace.  The sadhaka can only tolerate the light of illumination when the guru  reveals his form to him. Otherwise, he will close his eyes to keep from  being blinded. The divine sound becomes so powerful that the sadhaka  cannot tolerate it and may even die. The guru slowly gives the disciple  the capacity to tolerate it.</p>
<p>The great saints all instruct their  disciples to remain on the path of spiritual practice and truth by  eating vegetarian food, keeping away from intoxication, and promising  not to harm other men or animals.</p>
<p>On this occasion, Baba gave  initiation (Nam Dan) to many people, as well as marrying a number of  couples without dowry. Booths for buying tickets for travel were  available on the ashram grounds, and the ashram itself had several  thousand volunteers driving cars to those destinations.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Path of the Kali Yuga is Service</h3>
<p>The  clear road to spiritual attainment in the Kali Yuga is service and  devotion. If the jiva learns to consecrate his life then all success  will be his: his life will be filled with joy. In this age people are so  riddled with flaws that without the mercy of the spiritual master, no  one can go through life without a struggle.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of  the Guru Parva festival at his Mandir, Baba Jaigurudeva said to his  disciples that after a disciple gets guru, then there is nothing left  for him to obtain. His bondage to repeated birth and death comes to an  end. The devotee no longer has to take birth or die again. If he is  devoted to the guru then the mercy of the spiritual master will take him  across the ocean of miseries in a single moment.</p>
<p>Baba said that  like birth and death, the time for encountering a saintly person is  fixed in one’s destiny. But this is the most wonderful opportunity in a  person’s life. The moment has been decided even in a previous lifetime.  Through the good deeds that lead to good fortune, one also gets the  shelter of a saint. But without the mercy of Lord Hari, we do not even  give any attention to the company of saints. We must never forget the  Lord.</p>
<p>Baba blessed thousands of devotees and their families  individually. He blessed them and asked that they stay on the path of  truth, eat vegetarian food, and remember the name of God. Another  feature of the celebrations was that many poor boys and girls were  married without dowry.</p>

<p>Yesterday  was the Disappearance Day festival of Santana Goswami. The big festival  of circumambulating Govardhan in honor of Sanatan Prabhu takes place  over the five-day period ending on Purnima, with a major procession  leaving the Chakleshwar temple in Manasa Ganga.</p>
<p>Festivities at  the actual site of Sanatan Prabhu&#8217;s samadhi in Madan Mohan is a little  more subdued. Here are some pictures on Purnima, sent to us by Deena  Bandhu Dasji.</p>

So we put up a waterproof pandal for the festival.  Now it&#8217;s over, we will start construction. Since it is rainy season, we  had to put up a waterproof pandal so they could do the ceremonies  peacefully. This we volunteered to do as we had taken down the old Nat  Mandir.</p>

So we had to take it down. We  didn&#8217;t want to disturb the festival, so now it&#8217;s over, we will start  construction.</p>

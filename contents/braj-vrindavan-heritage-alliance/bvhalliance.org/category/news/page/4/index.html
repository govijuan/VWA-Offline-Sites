Ravikumar, to present a memorandum on the laying of 25 foot deep sewage  line in the Vrindavan, Parikrama Marg. The delegation communicated the  BVHA’s concern that the sewage line near Kalidaha on the Parikrama Marg.</p>
<p>They noted that while underground water can only be found at a depth  of 15 feet, it would be disastrous if the potable water were to be  contaminated in the areas where the sewage line is being laid. The  Yamuna, which has been Vrindavan’s lifeline for centuries, is now  polluted. If the ground water is polluted, this will cause trouble for  everyone. Access to pure drinking water is a fundamental human right.</p>
<p>The District Magistrate asked the delegation to find independent  civil engineers who can go through the project plan and find flaws in  it. The D.M. said he would welcome any expert comment on this issue and  will organize V.I.P. treatment to any independent engineer who comes  from outside to evaluate the plan.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the BVHA core-members decided to request the School of  Planning and Architecture in Delhi to study the government plan and  comment on it.</p>
<p>The delegation comprised of Madan Bihari Das, Naresh Narain, Ram  Narain Brajwasi, Chandra Lal Sharma, Jagannath Poddar, Shri Krishna  Saras, Vishnu Pada Das, and Madhumangal Shukla..</p>
<p>The delegation met the D.M. following the decision made in the  general meeting of the BVHA. Addressing the gathering Baba Sohani Sharan  ji Maharaj, currently in-charge of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1921762976767.108032.1622852566&amp;l=069bfba550">Shri Radha Bawri</a>,  said that the saints of Vrindavan took many initiatives of water  conservation, but the blind race for development has destroyed our water  culture. Shri Radha Bawri is one of such initiatives taken in the past.</p>
<p>Shri Radhe Shyam Beriwala, a prominent social worker, said that the  25 feet deep sewerage line laying in the Parikrama Marg by the  government will bring disaster for Vrindavan. The Yamuna which is used  to be life line for Vrindavan is already polluted now there is  preparation to spoil the underground water.</p>
<p>BVHA convener Shri Bal Krishna Gautam said that the area where the  sewage line is being laid is on the Yamuna flood plain, therefore  underground water is available in ten feet deep. BVHA assistant convener  Acharya Naresh Narain said that hand pumps in that locality are already  pumping out water mixed with the sewage as the sewage treatment plant  built nearby under the Yamuna Action Plan has already been spoiling  ground water from before. So the whole scenario is a complete disaster.</p>
<p>BJP city president Shri Krishna Saras said that a memorandum has  already been presented to the Divisional Commissioner of Agra on this  issue, but no action has been taken so far on it. Dr. Chandra Prakash  Sharma and Ram Narain Brajwasi from the Panda Sabha said that this is  the time to save Vrindavan or we will only read about this holy town in  religious books.</p>
<p>Many others also addressed this meeting and it was unanimously  decided that the delegation led by Shri Madan Bihari Baba should be sent  to meet the District Magistrate with the memorandum.</p>
<p>Just off the Mathura Road, a few hundred meters down the Gurukula  Marg, one comes to the Radha Bawri ashram, which is run by the Haridasi  sampradaya based in Tatia Sthan. They own at least five acres of land,  which they preserve in a traditional manner. They have a goshala and  have also been planting a lot of trees lately. There are many peacocks,  koils and other birds that are rarely seen in the Vrindavan of today.</p>
<p>This place is the site of Haridas Swami’s birth. The actual name of the village is Rajpur. A <em>bawri</em> is a walk-in well. Unfortunately, the water in this well doesn’t look  particularly clean these days. The surrounding area is typical old  Vrindavan, though the greedy eye of developers and land-mafia types  seems to be on it.

The letter says that  21,950 trees were planted in Vrindavan in the financial year of  2010-2011. Mr. Gautam says that if even ten percent of those trees  survived, portions of Vrindavan would have become completely green. He  said that the BVHA will ask the Forestry Department to elaborate the  location where those trees were planted.</p>
<p>When asked if there was any effort done in order to check the  population of the monkeys in the Braj region, the answer was in  negative. Mr. Gautam said the monkeys are the number second enemy of the  trees to the greedy builders, who cut the trees to build flats and  Malls.  Mr. Gautam is also sad to know that the department doesn’t know  which blocks of Mathura District come under the Taj Trapezium Zone. The  letter says it was not a concerned question with the department.</p>
<p>How much compensation did the department get against cutting the  trees in Vrindavan under the Samagra Vikas Yojna. It says the department  got Rs. 10063312. The BVHA demands that this amount should be spent in  Vrindavan only. The department has also given a disappointing answer on  if any measures are being taken to protect the trees in Ramanreti where  the soil on the top of roots of the trees were paved with concrete and  the water can’t reach the roots. The department replied in negative.</p>
<p>Mr. Gautam said that he will discuss this issue in the core committee  of the BVHA and if this issue needed will be taken to the court.</p>

The meeting was presided by the temple mahant, Dinabandhu Dasji, who  welcomed the Alliance members and said that all Brijvasis must dedicate  themselves to the protection of its patrimony.</p>
<p>Alliance deputy convenor Acharya Naresh Narain spoke of the sacred  nature of the temple site. “While Krishna was chastising Kaliya Nag,  Radharani and her sakhis were present here on Dwadashaditya Tila to  worship Surya Deva. The Madan Mohan temple itself is a place where  acharyas and perfected saints have engaged in their bhajan. The deity of  Madan Mohan appeared to Sanatan Goswami in this holy place.”</p>
<p>Convenor Bal Krishna Gautam said that the Archaeological Survey of  India has a very important role to play in the protection of ancient  monuments like the Madan Mohan temple, but it should expand its role.  “Unfortunately due to negligence, illegal construction is taking place  all around this temple, what to speak of others,” he said.</p>
<p>Acharya Gopalji, a well-known speaker of <em>Rama Charita Manasa</em> and Madhumangal Shukla called on the ASI needs to give the entire  district of Mathura serious attention because of the great number of  heritage sites such as the Yamuna River, many old temples and ashrams,  which are visited annually by around eight million pilgrims and  tourists.</p>
<p>Also present were Suresh Sharma, Dr. Chandra Prakash Sharma, Acharya  Vishnukant Shastri, Shrikrishna Saras, Giridhari Brajvasi, Ram Narayan  Brajvasi, Lakshmikant Sharma, Mahesh Chandra Sharma and others.</p>

It was observed that the Yamnua Pollution can  be  best managed in Vrindavan it being a very small place in area and no   pollutant industries are functioning here. The major challenge is the   sewerage which goes directly into the river Yamuna. None of the eighteen   old drains are tapped and the sewerage is directly going to the Yamuna   River, causing severe injury to the faith of hundreds of thousands of   pilgrims and devotees.</p>
<p>The  forum said that it supports Ramesh Baba’s Yamuna March from  Allahabad  to Delhi. It was unanimously approved that the conveners  should continue  the correspondence with the officials and decided to  present a  memorandum to the District Magistrate and the Divisional  Commissioner.  Some of the members noted that the Yamuna bank is again  being encroached  and the new colonies are coming up. A separate PIL  should be filed in  the Apex Court on the condition of Yamuna and its  bank just for  Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Vrindavan  can set an example for all the other towns of the country  on the Ganga  Yamuna basin. A Yamuna Task force in the district level  should be formed  including the officials from the various departments  of the Government.  A helpline should be set where people can make  complaints on the Yamuna  Pollution.</p>
<p>The  speakers were critical of the new storm water drains being built  under  the Samagra Vikas Yojna of the U.P. Government. They said all  the new  drains are being directed toward the Yamuna River. Any new  sewerage  treatment plants should be built across the river as the old  drainage  system is going towards the river. If the STP’s are built  across the  river, the sewerage will not be needed to be pumped back to  the STP as  it will go with its natural flow. The water can be used in  the farm  lands for the irrigation purposes once it is treated.</p>
<p>Shri  Madan Bihari Das, Swami Paramadvaiti, Chandra Prakash Sharma,  Rajendra  Agrawal, Giridhari Khandelwal, Govind Kishore Goswami, Bal  Krishna  Gautam (convener), Naresh Narain (Deputy convener), Devendra  Sharma,  K.G.Gupta, Madhumangal Shukla were some of the prominent  personalities  among the 35 persons who attended the meeting.</p>

Shri Madan  Bihari Das from Tatia Sthan chaired the meeting. It was felt that the  post of convener and deputy convener should be created for the smooth  functioning of the BVHA. It was also decided that there will not be any  post called the General Secretary or President.</p>
<p>The name of a seniormost member of the BVHA, Shri Bal Krishna Gautam,  was proposed for the post of convener. Then the name of Acharya Naresh  Narain was proposed as deputy convener. The forum unanimously approved  Shri Bal Krishan Gautam as convener and Shri Naresh Narain as his  deputy.</p>
<p>It was also decided that their tenure will be for three months only  and the next election for these posts will be held in the month of June.  The convener and the deputy convener will form a core committee with  the people who are interested to help them. The core committee will meet  from time to time and make an action plan to preserve and protect Braj  and Vrindavan’s built and natural heritage. The decisions taken in the  core committee will have to be approved by the general body.</p>
<p>The forum showed great concern fpr the condition of the Yamuna and  insisted on Yamuna Satyagraha action.

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.news.vrindavantoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_7229-720x480.jpg"><img title="IMG_7229 [720x480]" src="http://www.news.vrindavantoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_7229-720x480-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the meeting meeting held on February 13, 2011, at Pandavali Kunj, Keshi Ghat, it was agreed that the most important thing is to engage young people in field work for Vrindavan. To achieve this goal, several committees were created. Each committee is in charge of developing a specific area of seva in Vrindavan. Leaders for each committee were elected and confirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance Committees:<br />
<strong>*Organization Committee:</strong> Sri Hit Kinkar Sewak Sharan, Swami B. A. Paramadvaiti, Partha Sarthi Prabhu, acarya Devendra Caitanya and Chandan Goswami.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>*Legal Advice Committee:</strong> Rajveer Singh, Acharya Ramesh Chandra, Pratibha Sharma.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>* Clean Vrindavan Committee: </strong>Coordinator is Rajveer Singh, Vishnu Pada Das, Neeraj and Hanuman Das are part or the commitee. The NGO Food for Life has a lot of experience in this area. They have 64 workers cleaning different areas of Vrindavan daily. In this committee Vrinda Kunja participates with the project Helping Hands that is maintaining daily 6 workers who clean the Yamuna from Keshi Ghat up to Devraha Baba Mandir and on the other side from the Keshi Ghat up to the Imlitala Mandir. The next project of this committee is to install a drainage system to protect the Yamuna from sewage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>*Green Vrindavan Committee.</strong> Food for Life is also an active part of this committee, through Partha Sarthi Prabhu who is the representative for these meetings. They are in charge of improving the reforestation of Vrindavan. They have very good contacts and maintain these plantations. Partha Sarthi will contact Pratibha Mataji to participate on the committee. Nandu Das and Mohan will give their experience in landscaping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>*Stop Noise Committee:</strong> Although all music in Vrindavan is devotional, many mandirs are getting used to put music with a very high volume, which affect the acoustics in the atmosphere. Two young and very active Brijvasis are participating in this committee. One is Neeraj from The Braj Foundation and the other is Mayank. They are in charge of finding all the places with this problem, to then harmonize with the Mahantas of each mandir and ask them to play bhajans and Hari katha with lower volume. Acarya Ramesh Chandra will be the senior representative of this committee.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>*Traffic Control Committee:</strong> The main traffic problem in Vrindavan is produced by the floating population. This means all the pilgrims that come to Vrindavan in their cars. The goal of this committee is to achive a Vrindavan free of traffic. They are going to work in different proposals that then are going to be presented in a general assembly. Rajveer Singh will work in this committe with legal support.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An appointment was set with the D.M. and the SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) on Wednesday 17.11.10 at 11h30 to attend to the traffic matter in Vrindavan</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are other committees devoloping, such as the <strong>Yamuna Clean Committee</strong> (Bal Mukund,Radhe Syam and Vishnu Pada Das), <strong>Municipality Communications Committee</strong> (Rajveer Singh ,Pratibha Sharma, Madan Bihari Baba and Partha Sarthi), <strong>Public Relations Committee </strong>(Chandan Goswami, Man Mohan Parik),  <strong>Solid Waste Committee</strong> (Food for life) , <strong>Press Committee </strong>(Acarya Devendra Chaitanya), <strong>Yamuna Ghat Committee</strong> (which works to preserve the old ghats in Vrindavan Sundar Gopal Dasa is working in the office of Pandavali Kunj Ghat giving assitance to the people), <strong>Volunteering Committe</strong> (is composing a list with all the areas that can be cleaned or supported and also a list of available volunteers that can offer service to the different organizations that belongs to the BVHA), <strong>Internet &amp; Website Committe</strong> (Chandan Goswami, Acarya Ramesh Chandra, Acharya Devendra Chaitanya, Sameer, Katie Walter and Gandharvika Devi Dasi). <strong>Monkey Issue committee</strong> (Madhu Mangal Sukhla)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone is invited to participate in an active way, through the maintaining of webpages, designs, send online information, news in Vrindavan Today, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many young Brijvasis came today to the meeting and are very enthusiastic with the idea of supporting the different committees and with the idea of the service to Vrindavan. Guru Maharaj is working with these sadhus, acharyas and brajvasis for the benefit of Vrindavan.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In the upcoming week a meeting of the committees is planned for 3 p.m. at Pandavali Kunj</strong>. All are kindly invited.  The following week another general meeting is planned, possibly at Amiya Nimai Mandir.</p>

<p>Acharya Devendra Chaitanya pointed out that BVHA meetings have been  going on for the last year. Many people believe that these general  meetings are not important, but in fact they are. He also said some of  the declarations that were stated in the previous week’s meeting in  Nidhuvan were wrong, because we work with all foreigners and local  people. Anyone who wants to work with BVHAlliance is welcome.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Swami raised an important issue that occurred a couple  of days ago. Braj Bihari Maharaj, Mahanta from Char Sampradaya Ashram,  suffered an attack that almost cost him his life, by a land dispute. He  suggested that the BVHAlliance must be strongly against all this  violence.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Swami introduced Mayank Soni, a young Brijvasi who wants  to put his energy into the BVHAlliance. Both made a conceptual  framework that explains the work BVHAlliance was doing at this time, so  that people can know. He also noted that young people must  be more  involved in this tasks, to put more energy in our work. Of course, we  don’t want disparage or leave out all the senior leaders who are backing  what we are doing.</p>
<p>Also reported the progress that his organization has been doing in  cleaning up some sites in Vrindavan, the next clean-up projects and  highlighted the important support of NGO’s and Food for Life, who are  doing an excellent job in this connection.</p>
<p>Mayank stressed the importance of the work foreigners are doing to  clean Vrindavan. He said that, as a Brijvasi, he felt very inspired by  this daring to collaborate, Vrindavan is the house of Krishna and as  such should be kept clean.</p>
<p>Rajveer Singh said we must be realistic about the help the government  proposed. They might say they are going to support, but in practice it  is very difficult.</p>
<p>Given this discussion, members of the meeting nodded that the most  important is the practical work related done with people and also  continue to support private initiatives for the betterment of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Krishna Marga Devi Dasi also attended her first meeting and was very  lively to support the Alliance. She’s devoted more than 30 years and  love Vrindavan. Currently she is working with Bal Mukund Sastri in a  draft environmental awareness for children in schools.  Krishna Mataji   stressed the importance of working with children, because they are  completely open and able to educate parents about Vrindavan keep green  and clean. In addition, children are the future of Vrindavan. She  invited the Alliance to support this project.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Swami highlighted the work of volunteer engineer Luc  Stevens, who has been developing a master plan proposal covering  different areas of improvement in Vrindavan, which was sent to the  organization VITO in Belgium,  they conclude to come to Delhi early days  February to assess its involvement.</p>
<p>The next meeting of the BVHAlliance will be confirmed in the following days.</p>

<p>Summary, by Jagadananda Dasa<br />
This week’s BVHA meeting was held in Pandavali Kunj, next door to Keshi Ghat. This property belongs to the Gopinath Gaudiya Math, but by the grace of Acharya Shri Bhakti Bibudh Bodhayan Maharaj it has been set aside for service to Vrindavan Dham and will be used as offices for the BVHA. The building is a beautiful sandstone construction in the classical Vrindavan style, with an open courtyard. There is no deity service in the temple area. The meeting was held on the jagamohan.</p>
<p>Jagadananda Das opened the meeting with a prayer from Radha-sudha- nidhi, which says tat karmaiva karah karotu, “May my hands be engaged in the service of Radharani.” He suggested that this be the motto of the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance.</p>
<p>Swami Paramadvaiti gave an impassioned response. He said, “Thought there were no good roads, stones were brought from Rajasthan, rock by rock on bullock cart, to make the temples in Vrindavan. And how the workers carved the stone so beautifully by hand. Even today, when Kripaluji was building his temple on Chattikara Road, there were 900 artisans carving the images and reliefs on the marble. This kind of craftsmanship is one of the greatest riches in Vrindavan. When we lookat the old temples, they are nearly always decorated in a traditional style. Akshar Dham in Delhi has also shown that such kind of artistic workmanship can still be done if the finances and will are there.</p>
<p>“Morover,” he continued, “The beauty of Govindaji temple is diminished by the existence of so many surrounding encroachments. It really should be surrounded by gardens. Like the Gopinath temple, whosesevaits have vowed not to build any constructions in the gardens around the temple itself.”</p>
<p>In response, there were many comments. Modern hotels with glass walls are being built in Vrindavan now, ruining the traditional architectural homogeneity of the old town. Some of the new buildings have flush cement walls and are otherwise without any attempt at aesthetic beauty.</p>
<p>It was suggested that certain color restrictions should be made, as in Jaipur, and it should be required that all new buildings in Vrindavan should be designed in a way that has some connection to the Dham.</p>
<p>Mahanta Pradyumna of the Meera temple said that he was willing to take any pieces of red sandstone from old buildings that were being destroyed and keep them, even cataloging their source. It was also suggested that a restriction be placed on the size of store signs, so that they do not disfigure the facades of old buildings. A letter should be written to the municipality, MVDA, DM and CDO with this request.</p>
<p>Tamal Krishna Das noted that jirnoddhar or renovating an old temple is considered by the scriptures to be more glorious than building something new. He suggested that math and ashram leaders be encouraged to purchase and renovate old structures rather than building entirely new ones.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Maharaj said that BVHA should act as a watchdog, letting the authorities know what the sadhu and citizen population of Vrindavan desire.</p>
<p>Billboards were also mentioned as a blight on Vrindavan’s landscape. They are cluttering the town everywhere. Maharaj mentioned that even Sao Paolo in Brazil has banned billboards.</p>
<p>Madan Bihari Das Baba reported that he had met with Mahanta Satchitananda Das of the Char Sampradaya, who had promised to send kotwals to all associated ashrams and maths to give notification of the upcoming BVHA meeting to be held there at the next week meeting.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Maharaj showed a poster that was in preparation by his staff, showing all the problems that are being faced by Vrindavan. He said that he wanted to have them printed on chadar cloth rather than on plastic flax, which is contaminating. He said that they should be displayed in all the temples and ashrams as a way of sensitizing people to the issues. Neeraj agreed to translate the poster into Hindi.</p>
<p>Brahmacharini Shiromani from Vatsalya Gram was welcomed. She said that during the Kumbha Mela, Didi Ma (Sadhvi Ritambhara) and her guru Paramananda Puri Maharaj took a vow for the sake of the Yamuna. Vatsalya Gram uses no plastic. “Furthermore,” she said, “Did Ma is keenly eager to see Vrindavan’s sanctity preserved and is ready to<br />
cooperate with the BVHA in any way possible.” All the active members of the BVHA were delighted that a respected representative of Vatsalya Gram had come and welcomed the declaration of commitment from Sadhvi Ritambhara communicated by Brahmacharini Shiromani.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Maharaj said that the MVDA and Municipality are making big investments in the nalas and sewers, but bad planning means that they are full of standing water. This makes water borne diseases like malaria and typhoid even more probable when the season comes. These are dangerous diseases like cerebral malaria that can kill. Moreover, the pipes are inadequate for the sewage. What is being installed is not sustainable.<br />
Luc Stevens is leading a research about the treatment of waters in Vrindavan. With this information, BVHAllianc can make proposals andletters to the autorithies.</p>
<p>Resolutions:<br />
-Rajveer Singh becomes an official public relationship secretary of BVHAlliance.<br />
-Man Mohan Parik will stay in touch with Rajeev Singh to do typing of the official letters.<br />
-Parthasarthi prabhu will finish his letter about constructions for the next week.<br />
-BVHAlliance will promote the adoption and restore of old buildings instead of make new temples.<br />
-We will clean the illegal dumping ground in front of Tathia Sthan.<br />
-Our cloth´s poster will be translated into hindi by Neeraj prabhu. Next week the design will be finished.<br />
-We will make a facebook group to promote all the activities and different resolutions of BVHAlliance.<br />
-Next meeting will be held on Char Sampradaya office on Sunday 16th.</p>

<p>Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance Meeting Sunday 16th January 2011<br />
At Char Sampradya Ashram.</p>
<p>Former Chairman Chtura Sampradya vrakta prishad mandal Sri Mahant  Phuldol Bihari das agreed to work with BVHA.  He wants to stop  production of polythene bags and other products which are polluting the  atmosphere and environment.  He expressed that the meetings are  extremely important however we need all unanimous actions regarding  these issues.</p>
<p>We can organise a sign campaign, it can protest against use of plastic  and other products that are harming the environment.  We hope it will  take place in a nice manner with the blessing of Radharani and Lord  Krishna.  He gave clearance to do such concrete work to develop  Vrindavan Heritage and Holy Mother River Yamuna.</p>
<p>Paramadvaiti Maharaj from Vrinda Kunj stated that these meetings are  important and we must not give up.  He said that Dr Gautam, the General  Director of ASI and the Tourist Ministry have given great interest to  save the heritage of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>He said we need a clear picture of what Vrindavan needs, a Master Plan,  necessary for all to study.  There needs to be a concerted agreement of  what the Government and Municipality needs to do and what Vrindavan  needs to do?<br />
We need to target government officials to apply the necessary processes to de-pollute Vrindavan.</p>
<p>We need to make a statement to the Supreme Court and ASI (Archaelogical  Survey of India) of these urgent issues so that BVHA can work together  with them.</p>
<p>We need to agree on issues and make changes, visit persons concerned and communicate with these Organisations and Ministries.</p>
<p>Mahesh Khandelwal, Spiritual Industrialist from Vrindavan, explained  time punctuality to work for our city of Holy Mother Yamuna.  He is  producing a tight schedule to work for Vrindavan starting from five am  until ten pm.  He begins with morning meditation, laughing session and  hard work to develop Vrindavan Heritage after a long time he decided to  work with BVHA because he feels this front is working hard and  concretely.  He agreed to work with BVHA what time punctuality is  necessary to work together because he has many engagements in different  fields.  He suggested building a separate canal from Delhi to Agra along  with river transport, it would be very cheap.  He gave an example of  transportation to Mumbai which is more expensive than Dubai.  So we can  save money by toll and other fuels that we are using in transportation.   Water transport is than cheaper and cleaner than road transport.<br />
This was once suggested in Parliament by a former Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahendra Nath Chaturvedi, Braj Welfare Association Mathura,  explained the whole situation of Holy River Yamuna which is having  receiving so many pesticides, too much pollution and zero flow of water  in different parts.  So much pollution is coming through Yamuna, Gokul  Beraje and other dams.  He is going to Lucknow along with BVHA  representative Devendra Chaitanya and Paramadvaiti Maharaj to join  Lokbharti Seminar on River pollution and management.<br />
Many organizations and NGO’s are going to join this meeting on the 22nd and 23rd of January 2011.</p>
<p>Chairman Chtura Sampradya vrakta prishad mandal Sachchidanad Maharaj  Gopal Mandir Pathara pura Vrindavan, was very happy to organize the  meeting of BVHA at Char Sampradya Ashram.  He was afraid that his  colleague Mahants who received information about this meeting and they  could not attend today.  He assured BVHA to do concrete work for  development of Vrindavan and preserving the original Yamuna, which must  be pollution free.</p>
<p>In this meeting Madur Mangal Shukla, Arup Govind Das, Madan Bihari Das,  Brij Bihari Das and many other important members delivered their  opinions to develop the Heritage of Vrindavan and Yamuna gi.  More than  thirty people attended this meeting.</p>
<p>Achairya Devendra Chaitanya, the General Secretary of BVHA inviting the aforementioned lecturers.</p>

Since we have been posting the riverfront situation in Rishikesh and  Hardwar, I thought that this would be nice to post here also, to get an  idea of how, even in Mathura, good work is being done. Why not  Vrindavan? It staggers the imagination.</em></p>
<div>
<hr />
I was  invited to see the work that had been taking place at the Mathura Ghats a  few days ago and enthusiastically went with the camera to see the  results.The Ghats in Mathura are the most mentioned tirtha in  all of the shastra. The Yamuna near Mathura is a repository of the  pastimes associated with Krishna. The river bank is embellished with  stone steps leading to the surface of the water. Each ghat has a story  associated with it. The city of Mathura is spread on the right bank of  the Yamuna and the ghats, temple spires and archways provide a wonderful  view from the opposite bank.</p>
<p>It is believed that the ghats were  built at the sites of ancient ashrams, where the great sages performed  their penances. Today they are crowded with pilgrims who visit these  sacred sites for the ritual dip in the water. Of the 25 ghats that exist  today, Vishram Ghat is the most important. It is stated in shastra that  Lord Krishna rested here after killing the tyrant demon Kansa.</p>
<p>The  12 ghats to the north of Vishram Ghat include the Ganesh Ghat,  Dashashwamedh Ghat with its Neelakantheshwar Temple, Saraswati Sangam  Ghat, Chakratirtha Ghat, Krishnaganga Ghat, Somatirth or Swami Ghat,  Ghantagharan Ghat, Dharapattan Ghat, Vaikuntha Ghat, Navtirtha or  Varahkshetra Ghat, Asikunda ghat and Manikarnika Ghat.</p>
<p>To the  south, of Vishram Ghat there are 11 ghats &#8211; the Guptatirth Ghat, Prayag  Ghat marked by the Veni Madhav Temple, Shyam Ghat, Ram Ghat, Kankhal  Ghat, the site of the Janmashtami and Jhula festivals, Dhruva ghat,  Saptrishi Ghat, Mokshatirth Ghat, Surya Ghat, Ravan Koti Ghat and Buddha  Ghat.</p>
<p>Some of the most elegant temples of Mathura, like the  Mukut Temple, Radha-Damodar, Murli Manohar, Neelkantheshwar,  Yamuna-Krishna, Langali Hanuman and Narasimha temples are situated near  Vishram Ghat. The baithak of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, is also nearby.</p>
<p>There  importance to all Vaishnavas from all sampradayas cannot be estimated.  So it is wonderful that some restoration is taking place.</p>

<h3>Yamuna today is what Thames was 150 yrs ago</h3>
<p>Malvika Baru Sharma | New Delhi (The Pioneer)</p>
<p><strong>The river Yamuna, <a href="http://www.dailypioneer.com/233303/Tragic-death-of-a-river.html">having been declared dead</a> with its water all poisonous from 22 drains from all over Delhi feeding <a href="http://www.dailypioneer.com/233266/‘Yamuna-a-flowing-mass-of-faeces’.html">800 million gallons of sewage</a> into it per day, can kill a healthy human being.</strong> It&#8217;s the rapid industrialisation that is helping the inevitable pollute  to the river, pointed out Robert Oates, Director, Thames Rivers  Restoration Trust (TRRT), and the industrial revolution of India is 10  times that of England when it took place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not just  Government&#8217;s but every citizen of Delhi&#8217;s responsibility to make sure  that the river&#8217;s cleanliness is restored and its purity revived,&#8221; he  said. The Indian National Trust For Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH)  South Asia Network for Dams, Rivers &amp; People (SANDRP), Toxics Link  and Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan (YJA) organised a lecture by Robert Oates of  TRRT in the Capital on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a presentation, the TRRT  detailed how the whole Thames river restoration project was undertaken.  TRRT is an independent charity in the UK dedicated to improving the  Thames river in London and its tributaries to benefit people and nature  and it has done some pioneering work in recent years. Robert explained  that what all difficulties TRRT had to face 150 years back will not be  faced by Delhi&#8217;s governance with all its knowledge and technical  advances like GIS at their behest. &#8220;<strong>It might not take as long as 50  years for the whole restoration project of Yamuna. It might take even  less than 15 years if all goes to plan,&#8221; he said</strong>.</p>
<p>Yamuna  today is what London&#8217;s Thames was 150 years ago, with all its water  polluted almost irrevocably. It seemed impossible to restore it to its  natural state, but it was good governance that brought life back to the  river. Oates was there to share all the experiences of his to revive the  Thames and if there were any lessons for the efforts to help revive the  river Yamuna in Delhi. SK Mishra, Chairman, INTACH, Ramaswamy Iyer and  Manoj Mishra of YJA pointed out along with Oates the right measures that  should be undertaken to improve the health of Yamuna. The drains  dumping the sewage and the encumbered water flow are the two major  causes that impede the river.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;There are just 17 sewage  treatment plants which are not functioning to their designed capacity,  to serve the drains feeding 1,200 km of the Yamuna&#8230; Instead, the  Government is investing 1,500 crore rupees on <a href="http://www.dailypioneer.com/236165/Delhi-to-get-interceptor-sewer-project.html">an interception treatment plant</a> which is not even capable of treating the sewage</strong>,&#8221; said the presentation.</p>
<p>Thanks to Anant M. Vyas for the head&#8217;s up on that article.</p>

I  recently received the following letter from a devotee who doesn&#8217;t get  what the problem is with the bridge going by Keshi Ghat. Actually, he is  not the only one, but many seem to be confused about the fuss. On the  one hand, there are those with materialist vision, who see the bridge as  &#8220;progress&#8221; that will bring Vrindavan into the 21st century. On the  other are the devotees who think we should passively attempt to change  our vision and see the divine Vrindavan while pretending that whatever  happens on the surface is irrelevant to the way that our vision is  transformed. Here is his letter and my answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just  don&#8217;t get it. Why is everyone so concerned with the environment? It is  our master, we must accept what the environment is doing and carry on in  our devotional practices.</p>
<p>I was just in Vrindavan, it was  wonderful, words cannot do justice. My condolences to all of you people  concentrating on some material matter. You should be concentrating on  the beauty.</p>
<p>If you find a rock in your rasagulla you savor your  tooth breaking rather than the sweetness of the rasagulla, and then you  blame that on the sweetmaker.</p>
<p>Vrindavan will be beautiful with or without a bridge.</p>
<p>I  don&#8217;t know about you people but I know that I don&#8217;t have the devotion  to see that true transcendental Vrindavan, all I see is dust and stool. A  bridge is much nicer to look at than stool.</p>
<p>If you can see that  REAL Vrindavan, then please bestow upon me your mercy so that I too may  see what is REALLY there, so that I may see the lord of my heart with my  own eyes. Until I get sufficient devotion and mercy I will not see, so  please bestow upon me your mercy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter is a little  confused, since in the beginning you seem to be ignoring the stool and  then you say that you do see it, but that you find the bridge beautiful.  At any rate, you fail to see the connection between the two.</p>
<div>
But  to answer your question as to how to get the devotion and mercy so that  you can see the REAL Vrindavan, let me give you a few tips.</div>
<div>If  your heart is impure and full of desires, do you engage in purificatory  acts to make it proper for Krishna to reside there, or not?</div>
<div>Similarly,  if your temple were dirty, would you not think it necessary or  appropriate to clean it? Should the deities be nicely dressed and  offered food on clean dishes, and so on?</p>
<p>Did Mahaprabhu set an  example in the Gundicha temple, or did he say, &#8220;Jagannath likes it this  way&#8221; and leave it? And is it a devotional practice, <em>mandira-mArjanAdau</em>, or not?</p>
<p>And  when Narottam Das cleaned Lokanath Goswami&#8217;s stools, why didn&#8217;t he just  say, &#8220;My guru&#8217;s body is transcendental. His stools, like  Rishabhadeva&#8217;s, smell like roses. So I will revel in his stool; there is  no need to clean them&#8221;?</p>
<p>Actually, you are making the Ramachandra  Puri mistake. When Madhavendra Puri was dying and calling out in  separation to Radha and Krishna, Ramachandra Puri said, &#8220;What&#8217;s your  problem? You are a liberated soul. Why are you crying out in  separation?&#8221; Ishwar Puri recognized the opportunity for service and got  Madhavendra Puri&#8217;s mercy, while Ramachandra Puri&#8217;s career spiralled  downwards.</p>
<p>When Raghunath or Prabodhananda say that they dream of  sweeping the Divine Couple&#8217;s pleasure bower, is that incorrect of them?  Are they concentrating on some material matter because they clean the  kunja?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if someone comes to your parents&#8217; house and  desecrates it&#8211;let us say they come and drink alcohol and urinate in the  living room&#8211;do you just ignore it and see the spirit soul in them and  accept that they are acting according to the modes of nature and leave  whatever filth or nuisance they have done without question? Is Vrindavan  your home or not?</p>
<p>So is cleaning the environment in the Dham service to the environment or service to Guru, Gauranga and Gandharvika-Giridhari?</p>
<p>If you do not <strong>see</strong> the dirt, then you are exempt from cleaning it. But I would say, that  is your misfortune. Your guru has not shown you that this service is  there to be done.</p>
<p>He probably told you to sell books. Why? Isn&#8217;t everybody already eternally liberated and never separated from Radha and Krishna?</p>
<p>And  when you walk on the parikrama marga, I assume you don&#8217;t hear the cars  honking and nearly running you over. And when the bridge is built and  there are ten times as many cars, you will neither notice the fumes or  the increased noise. Better be careful, as one of those cars you neither  see nor hear, may run you over. But of course, there is no difference  between life and death, is there?</p>
<p>My dear friend, in fact, you  are very fortunate that you have had a positive experience of Vrindavan.  We wish that everyone else should also have as wonderful a pilgrimage  to this land as you have had.</p>
<p>Believe me, for those of us who  have been coming to or staying in Braj for the last 35 or 40 years, we  continue to come because we also see the transcendental beauty pervading  the land, and because we can feel the presence of Radha and Krishna  here. That is precisely why we feel this need to preserve and enhance  the special, sacred and spiritual character of Vrindavan, and feel it a  necessary act of PREACHING to do so.</p>
<p>Preaching is not just  selling books. Preaching is also about creating an environment that is  conducive for devotional service. Nowhere in the world, no temple, no  ashram, is as important a place for devotional service as the place  where Radha and Krishna had their pastimes.</p>
<p>That is why Chaitanya  Mahaprabhu sent Sri Rupa and Sanatan there, not to convert anyone, but  to discover and reveal the holy places where the Divine Couple had their  pastimes. This was part of their PREACHING mission. Braj was that  important to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And so, one of the first things he  did when he had stalwart and worthy disciples was to send them to Braj  to do this.</p>
<p>When these places get lost again, or inundated under a  ton of garbage, or paved over to make a four-laned highway, we will be  letting Rupa and Sanatan&#8217;s service be undermined. How can that be  pleasing to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu? We will have misunderstood a great  deal about bhakti and prema-rasa.</p>
<p>Rupa Goswami&#8217;s &#8220;upadesha-sara&#8221;,  &#8220;the essence of all instruction,&#8221; is to live in Vrindavan under the  shelter of a rasika devotee and hear and chant about Radha and Krishna&#8217;s  most intimate pastimes, i.e., to do bhajan and meditate on the  ashta-kaliya lila. You may not be ready to do that, nor may many others,  but Vrindavan and the other places in Braj Dham should be developed in  such a way that this is the ideal environment to do just that.</p>
<p>Sadhus  naturally want a peaceful, beautiful, sacred environment to do their  bhajan. Where will they go if this place is ruined for bhajan? Is there  an alternative to Vrindavan? Can we make a New Vrindavan that is as good  as the old one?</p>
<p>There is no alternative. We must serve and  preserve the Holy Dham that Rupa and Sanatan, and Haridas Swami, and  Vallabhacharya, and Hit Harivams, and Hari Vyasa, and the acharyas of  all the rasika sampradayas chose as their place of bhajan. We have no  choice. NONE.</p>
<p>Jai Sri Radhe!!</p></div>

<p>At today&#8217;s hearing, the Court has  asked the State Government how it is that the funds for the bridge  construction work were sanctioned and distributed when the Tourism  Master Plan of Vraj Region (Vrindavan Samagra Vikas Pariyojana) has not  yet been sanctioned? An answer as to why the construction work was  started without obtaining a no objection certificate from the Apex Court  was also demanded.</p>
<p>The court also issued notices to several  government departments and asked them to respond. A second hearing is  set for the 29th of March.</p>
<p>Please keep praying to Shri Radha and Krishna to save our Yamuna Maharani.</p>

<p>At the same time, at Triveni Ghat, which is right  downtown, the Ganga bed is being diverted to come closer to the ghat  itself. In recent years, the water only reaches the steps during the  rainy season. Now it will be possible to descend the steps into the holy  river all year round.</p>
<p>It looks to me that some good ideas are available here for the Vrindavan parikrama marg, if anyone can get the message across.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35OoJ8UZII/AAAAAAAAA14/1oSKb7dmmtI/s1600-h/SDC10357.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439871851680785538" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35OoJ8UZII/AAAAAAAAA14/1oSKb7dmmtI/s400/SDC10357.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
This  picture shows how the digging of the new channel is progressing. The  central portion, where the backhoe is digging, is to be entirely  removed, according to the engineers that I met there.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35OmycmyjI/AAAAAAAAA1o/I-9jtEN0U9c/s1600-h/SDC10340.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439871828193888818" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35OmycmyjI/AAAAAAAAA1o/I-9jtEN0U9c/s400/SDC10340.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
Here is the famous Bhagavad Gita statue at Triveni Ghat.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35PaU0XLCI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/aPhKZoed6JI/s1600-h/SDC10351.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439872713593662498" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35PaU0XLCI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/aPhKZoed6JI/s400/SDC10351.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
Spotted along the promenade are these lookout cupolas in an art deco style with wrought iron, very nice.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35OntBRmnI/AAAAAAAAA1w/Gm2sr2Tp2_w/s1600-h/SDC10344.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439871843916946034" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35OntBRmnI/AAAAAAAAA1w/Gm2sr2Tp2_w/s400/SDC10344.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
Further  downstream, you get an idea of how the pathway is being used or abused.  There is a Gangeshwar temple about one kilometer downstream from  Triveni Ghat. Here they were putting on a Shiva Purana Saptaha. Since  the walkway is not yet heavily used, it is not much of an inconvenience.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35PbSoBh9I/AAAAAAAAA2g/dIxvBFZgcSc/s1600-h/SDC10370.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439872730184910802" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35PbSoBh9I/AAAAAAAAA2g/dIxvBFZgcSc/s400/SDC10370.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
Here  you can see further downstream, towards the end of the promenade. The  Rajaji National Park is on the other side, offering a rare and beautiful  vision of greenery.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35Pa5_N6oI/AAAAAAAAA2Y/HlFGVchiDQI/s1600-h/SDC10382.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439872723571305090" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35Pa5_N6oI/AAAAAAAAA2Y/HlFGVchiDQI/s400/SDC10382.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
A good idea: Providing pumps along the way so that tourists can get a drink.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35PZt9eW_I/AAAAAAAAA2A/T0b7hUog_WM/s1600-h/SDC10364.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439872703162899442" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S35PZt9eW_I/AAAAAAAAA2A/T0b7hUog_WM/s400/SDC10364.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>

It is quite nicely done and could be seen as a  reference for how things could be done at Vrindavan.</p>
<p>This first  picture is taken from the gondola lift to Manasa Devi. You can see the  old Ganga bed on the far side and the canal segment running next to the  town. There are actually several channels and hydroelectric generators  in more than one location. But the organization of the waterways has  been effective. The main highway runs in between them, but there is also  a nice green park in that space. The main Kumbha Mela tent city is on  the far side of the bridge that crosses the Ganga to the upper left of  the picture.</p>
<div>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qA5z0WQI/AAAAAAAAA1I/MpJnGr00uV4/s1600-h/Haridwar_Ganga_08.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439831594916665602" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qA5z0WQI/AAAAAAAAA1I/MpJnGr00uV4/s400/Haridwar_Ganga_08.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
This  picture is taken from the Hardwar city side looking toward the above  mentioned green area between the canal and old Ganges bed. Ghats line  both sides of the canal. Since the hills run quite close to the river,  the town is quite narrow. The market section is in the Harki Pauri area.  In both directions away from Harki Pauri there are hundreds of ashrams,  some quite prosperous, as well as hotels, etc.</div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34p_t77BbI/AAAAAAAAA04/e0Pj3T_qNtU/s1600-h/Haridwar_Ganga_02.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439831574549562802" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34p_t77BbI/AAAAAAAAA04/e0Pj3T_qNtU/s400/Haridwar_Ganga_02.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
The  image below shows a painted slogan on the ghat wall. It says &#8220;India&#8217;s  soul resides in its holy places. India&#8217;s development lies in the  development of her holy places.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qAZfswgI/AAAAAAAAA1A/MGzl1nwXYes/s1600-h/Haridwar_Ganga_03.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439831586242347522" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qAZfswgI/AAAAAAAAA1A/MGzl1nwXYes/s400/Haridwar_Ganga_03.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />
Looking  upstream from a bridge, the name of which I forget. There are quite a  few bridges crisscrossing the canal portion of the Ganga, which is where  most of the bathing goes on. Many were built just for the Kumbha and  most are for pedestrian traffic alone. Most come to bathe at Harki  Pauri, which is in this direction but cannot be seen on the photo.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qZrTxzdI/AAAAAAAAA1g/93lK7xGauOA/s1600-h/Haridwar_Ganga_05.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439832020520914386" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qZrTxzdI/AAAAAAAAA1g/93lK7xGauOA/s400/Haridwar_Ganga_05.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>Looking  downstream from the same bridge. The park is on the left side. You can  see there are many bridges&#8211;even more have been built to facilitate  bathing for the Kumbha Mela. It gives an almost Budapestian flavor to  the site.</div>
<div>Bridges in themselves are not a  problem. The problem with the Keshi Ghat bridge is that it defaces the  architectural and natural beauty of Vrindavan, as well as destroying the  relationship of the pilgrim to the sacred character of the town. Here,  the contrary has been achieved.</div>
<div>
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qZIVW2sI/AAAAAAAAA1Y/P4VyEvK6ohg/s1600-h/Haridwar_Ganga_04.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439832011132295874" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qZIVW2sI/AAAAAAAAA1Y/P4VyEvK6ohg/s400/Haridwar_Ganga_04.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>Another view from the same ghat as above.</p>

<div>Here is a scene of the original Ganga bed, with donkeys bringing stones across.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qBdVFqMI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/ueUApa4B2K8/s1600-h/Haridwar_Ganga_06.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439831604451453122" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N5dUfu0zrwA/S34qBdVFqMI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/ueUApa4B2K8/s400/Haridwar_Ganga_06.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div>On  the whole, I was quite favorably impressed by Haridwar. Clearly a great  amount of money has come in for the Kumbha Mela, but the money appears  to have been well used. There are still spots that are glaringly unkept,  but much of the riverfront is in good condition and is being kept  clean.</div>
<div>Both Haridwar and Rishikesh are showing  signs of development that both demonstrates an awareness of pilgrim  tourism and the enhancement of their natural beauty. In both places, car  traffic is kept away from the waterfront areas and sufficient space is  being set aside for peaceful promenades.</div>
<div>If  only Vrindavan could take inspiration and develop its Parikrama Marg  with the same philosophy. The topography naturally favors this kind of  development in Rishikesh and Haridwar, nevertheless, it is the end  result we must look at.</div>

Certainly on the trip to Vrindavan, two entire days were lost  in traveling. May I never take the Utkal Express again.</div>
<div>Got  into Vrindavan well after midnight. Was up late in the morning, but  started off immediately for Keshi Ghat. As usual, it was a dreadful  shock to see the garbage piled up in the old ghats, the running nalas  overflowing onto the road, and general mess and neglect. You can see <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/02/rishikesh-promenade.html">here</a> and <a href="http://bvhalliance.blogspot.com/2010/02/haridwar-waterfront_8594.html">here</a> that even in India, it does not have to be so. You can see pictures of the kind of situation that prevails on the <a href="http://yvhf.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/save-yamuna-save-vrindavan-2/">Yamuna Vrindavan Heritage Alliance website</a>. Just scroll down through this slideshow to get an idea.</div>
<div>
<div>On  the way, I noticed that there was activity at one of the sewage  treatment plants along the Parikrama Marga, so I stopped in to see what  the story was. The engineer there told me first of all that the plant  was functioning. I asked him whether the pipes that had been laid  throughout the western part of the town came through to his plant and he  said they would eventually, but that at present they did not get that  far. Furthermore, since the pipes were inadequate to the task, being too  small, the whole job would have to be done over again.</div>
<div>Now  this sounds to me like the most egregious bit of incompetence that I  have ever heard of. A huge sum of money was given to do this bit of  essential infrastructure work and due to corruption (I have no doubt  whatsoever that this is the case) the money has been frittered away and  the Vrindavan streets are left in complete disarray, resulting in  regular accidents, broken axles and bent wheels on rickshaws, etc., etc.</div>
<div>The  other day I took a rickshaw ride from Vrinda Kunj to Bhakti Dham, and  on the way, the rickshaw&#8217;s front wheel took a whack on a rugged piece of  road, and the driver had to take a detour to the repairman. It cost him  40 Rs, exactly what I was paying him. That is the situation.</div>
<div>I  regularly berate the rickshaw wallas, many of whom are Bengalis, for  not demonstrating to the Municipal authorities to protest. Why don&#8217;t  they block the streets to call attention to the corruption and the  mismanagement of these public works projects? They are surely among the  most affected.</div>
<div>They tell me this is not Marxist  West Bengal, where the little man at least gets a voice. Here, no one  listens to the lowest of the low, especially not if they come from out  of state. Bengalis are not held in great esteem. Too bad that one who  was, Nimai Maitra, the prominent local RSS leader, just died recently.  He might have intervened.</div>
<div>Someone  told me the laughing-in-my-beard story the other day about a rickshaw  ride she had taken. They came to one of these dug up streets and she  decided to get down to at least make it easier for the wallah to get  over the hump. As they were going through the rocky patch, they passed a  poor rickshaw driver who was struggling with a vehicle overflowing with  no less than five well-endowed pilgrims from Delhi or somewhere. My  friend started to berate the group asking them whether they had no  consideration and could they not see what their driver was having to go  through. Before the dumbstruck group could answer, the rickshaw&#8217;s axle  broke, the carriage overturned and the five chubby Indians fell into the  muddy street.</div>
<div>It would  have been a jolly good Schadenfreude laugh, except that the thoughtless  privilegiés immediately started to blame the hapless rickshaw wallah for  the disaster. Of course, he did not get paid and was stuck with the  bill for repairs. Not a good day for him.</div>
<div>On  my way to Vrindavan, I had the pleasure to accompany a group I  encountered accidentally in the waiting room in Hardwar (our train was  delayed 8 hours). Sankirtan Das, a Swiss devotee who has been living in  China for the last 20 years and speaks fluent Chinese, was with a group  of 10 people from a city outside Beijing, maybe Tongzhon. Sankirtan  Dasji has written a book, which has also been translated into Chinese,  called <em><a href="http://www.vedamsbooks.com/no60487.htm">Bhakti Yoga Pilgrimage</a></em>. He has been running tours like this for some time.</div>
<div>The  leader of the group, a striking woman with the given name Kunti, is the  owner of 15 (!) yoga centers in her town and most of the others in the  group were teachers in those centers. They had spent a few days in  Rishikesh, at Madhuvan, doing yoga and looking around.</div>
<div>The  Chinese pilgrims were very sweet. Sankirtan told me they had spent part  of the previous day in Hardwar doing kirtan at Harki Pauri, which had  attracted a great deal of attention, as you can imagine. We also spent a  few hours on the train doing kirtan. The man is indeed true to his  name.</div>
<div>Anyway, since many  of the Chinese wear glasses, I was warning them about the Vrindavan  monkeys. I told them about how the last time I had been with  Paramadvaiti Maharaj in Vrindavan, out behind the Rangaji temple, a  monkey had stolen his glasses and had simply mashed them to bits in full  view of everyone.</div>
<div>It  used to be that in Vrindavan there were only a few places where monkeys  stole people&#8217;s glasses. I have good experience of this. The main places  were at Chir Ghat and in front of the Shahji Mandir near Loi Bazar and  Radha Raman. There may have been other places, but those two I know  about. At Shahji Mandir one time I was even in a rickshaw and a monkey  flew past me, picking off my specs. The thing was that the monkeys and  the local residents had a kind of symbiotic relationship. The monkey  would steal the glasses, the Brajvasis would have chola and other  goodies at the ready, they would offer the monkey a bribe, which the  clever creature happily accepted, dropping the glasses. A local youth  (as it was usually young men and kids who would be competing for the  prize) would then offer them back to the owner and get a reward&#8211;50 to  100 rupees.</div>
<div>But in  Paramadvaiti Maharaj&#8217;s case, the monkey had somehow learned the first  part of the lesson, &#8220;I monkey. Steal glasses.&#8221; But had not learned the  second part, &#8220;Get food. Drop glasses.&#8221; The learned behavior is spreading  through Vrindavan&#8217;s monkey community, but the parampara has been broken  in the course of time, <em>kaleneha mahata yogo bhrashtaH parantapa</em>.</div>
<div>Now  I was to encounter the same situation. As I approached Chir Ghat, I  began to think that it would be wise to take my specs off. But when your  eyesight is as bad as mine, you tend to want to wait to the last  moment. Perhaps all the construction that is there has driven the  predatory beasts further afield, who knows, but I waited too long. A  large monkey leaped past me, and with barely the sense of being touched,  only the whiff of a breeze, my nose was naked.</div>
<div>And  there was no one around to come to my rescue. No Brijbasis with  biscuits for the beast. I ran to get biscuits and came back, blind as a  bat and unable to even see where the evil creature had gone. Someone  pointed him out, sitting atop a wall, meditatively crunching away at my  ocular prosthesis. I threw him as many biscuits as I could, but the  wicked beast looked at me with indifference. A crowd of his progeny  danced around picking up the crumbs, and when I let down my hand in  despair, another snatched the remaining biscuits from my hand. Such is  the new treachery of these maleficent anthropoids. Don&#8217;t call them  mischievous, they are a menace.</div>
<div>And  so, taking it that I had been delivered by Radharani herself from  seeing the hulking skeleton of a half-moon bridge and the rest of the  disasters that it had brought to the area, I walked on towards Keshi  Ghat for the kirtan. I stopped just to talk to a few of the inactive  construction workers who were hanging about. They said, &#8220;The work has  only stopped temporarily. There is an nefarious rich lady in Keshi Ghat  who is manipulating the powers-that-be to deprive us of our jobs, but  our bosses have assured us it is only for one month.&#8221;</div>
<div>So  that&#8217;s the situation. Katie Jo Walter and others are working very hard  to get the court case on the 23rd prepared, thinking of all arguments  that could come up and how to counter them. Let us keep on praying. Some  people are thinking of doing another kirtan on that day, so I ask you  to do so. It may not be as public and well-publicized as the Global  Kirtan on the 30th, but do not forget this work. It is not something  that can be done in one or two days. We need to keep on praying,  chanting, asking Srimati Radharani to intervene so that we can build up  our strength, chase away the destructive materialistic forces and  recreate Vrindavan in a way that does an honor to our beloved Yugal  Kishore.</div>

<p>B.A.  Paramadvaiti opened  the meeting with a call to re-estabish commitment  for BVHA, asking all to vow to sustain the unity required and not let it  fall – be sensitive, apologize – always keep big picture in mind – put  aside ego.</p>
<p>B.A. Paramadvaiti Visited Rang ji Mandir mahant – he  was almost crying saying that for 150 yrs he been using Yamuna water for  pujas and finally had to stop because it was so dirty.</p>
<p>He also got support from Brahma Kund Goswami and the acharya for Gopeshwar Mandir<br />
Madhusudan  Maharaj spoke to Ramesh Baba – 11th Ramesh Baba will demonstrate at  DM’s office in Mathura and wants Vrindavan to join him.</p>
<p>Ramesh Baba will host a sadhu samelan in his tent on the 17th. BVHA should prepare a presentation.</p>

<p>What subjects discussed on 17th?<br />

-bridge<br />
-cleanup/pollution</p>
<p>Gill  supported Ashok Singhal (VHP) meeting. Ashok Singhal said he can get  all spiritual leaders to Lucknow to protest &amp; friends w/ Mayawati</p>
<p>It was noted that Mayawati might get angry at VHP involvement in the issue<br />
The  suggestion was made to present Mayawati with an alternative plan and  send her a letter saying that we (BVHA) are not against her, we want to  help.</p>
<p>If anyone would present this to her, it would be Madhusudan &amp; Sevak Sharan.</p>
<p>Manjari  Devi Dasi: thought lawyer, Gill should be consulted – could be  counter-productive to approach Mayawati directly. Jagannath Poddar also  thought this was not a good idea.</p>
<p>Sevak Sharan said tell Mayawati  we are not trying to change her plan, but rather expand it out.  Reportedly, an aid close to Mayawati has relatives in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Madhusudan will use Vrindavan.com to feature the activities of all organizations working for Vrindavan.</p>
<p>GOAL: get 2-3 bullet point news items posted here each day on Vrindavan.com<br />
Noted  that the MVDA – is bulldozing land, destroying illegal encroachments  per court order – but bvha will still not accept their plan</p>
<p>Jagannath Poddar – Chakravedi – lawyer- let the court appoint? 98 Chakravedi case.</p>
<div>Jagannath  Poddar and a representative from Mathura only people appointed by the  central govt. MOEF – fund for national lake &amp; river conservation.</div>
<div>
Madhusudan Maharaj was appointed the official representative of Govardhan.</div>
<div>
Paramadvaiti visited Chidadananda – collected quotes against bridge.</div>
<div>
Madhumangal – should be supplied w/ camera.</div>
<div>
Jagannath Poddar &#8211; we need to get signatures from saints, mahants of Braj.</div>
<div>
Need  to centralize points for media- to report outside – counteract negative  points from local media. Need to keep tabs on what is being said in  favor of bridge in the local papers so we can refute these points.</div>
<div>
Need to physically approach people for 17th meeting.</div>
<div>
Jagannath Poddar – will create mission statement and get petition translated.</div>
<div>Paramadvaiti  – went to visit Mathura office to determine MVDA involvement and found  no involvement at all. The PWD was in charge, but they had no proper  plans either – the govt has been neglecting the town for a long time.</p>
</div>
<div>Paramadvaiti  Read his letter for the government – it was well-liked, but members  agreed a few points should be changed, shortened – could be used for  good small mission statement that leaders would support and unify the  people of Braj – Jagannath Poddar will work on editing this.</div>
<div>
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is reportedly against the bridge and said he would clean Yamuna from Delhi.</div>
<div>
Sevak Sharan will represent alliance at Kumbha Mela.</div>
<div>

<div>The petition finished, in digital edition by 10th</p>
</div>
<div>Should we approach Pushpa Sharma?<br />
Madhusudan – has connection with her from a film<br />
Sevak Sharan says – why not?<br />
Jagannath Poddar- it would be a waste of time, but may help heritage status<br />
Paramadvaiti –says we should approach everyone<br />
Prabhat Kumar Sharma of Mathura – helped organize kumbha mela and is being helpful<br />
Bhaktapur has status, why not Vrindavan?<br />
Jagannath Poddar approached Pushpa Sharma before but she was not interested at thattime’<br />
Madhusudan thinks it is good to approach her again.</div>
<div>
Next meeting at Madhumangal’s home February 14, 2010   2-4 PM<br />

Prema Narayan Das asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Destroy  the holy dham? how does one destroy what is eternal? I don&#8217;t have the  vision to see the glories of that land regardless of man-made  infrastructure. My param guru maharaja told we are at the mercy of the  environment, so all our energy should be spent towards harmonization of  our minds with the environment. I think it&#8217;s so we can try to serve  undisturbed. Also I think if Krishna didn&#8217;t want something to happen it  wouldn&#8217;t happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone should act according to their  faith. But if you want to know the siddhanta preached by Bhaktisiddhanta  Saraswati and Bhaktivedanta Swami, then it is this: The world is real.  It is Krishna&#8217;s energy. Devotional service means engaging all the senses  of this body in Krishna&#8217;s service. That way the body, mind, and actions  are all spiritualized.</p>
<p>How do we do that? By making the material energy more closely resemble the spiritual.</p>
<p>What is the spiritual energy? It is the idealized concept of truth, beauty and love.</p>
<p>In  the language of the Gaudiya Mission, service done in this mentality is  called &#8220;preaching,&#8221; but it actually should be understood in much broader  terms than simply speaking about Krishna.</p>
<p>Words are the most  powerful tools in shaping our consciousness, but they are only part of  the story. Our minds are the clearing house of all sensual information,  therefore as far as possible we must inundate the mind with  spiritualized sense data.<br />
As our mind becomes transformed, it begins to interpret all data in a spiritual way.</p>
<p>The  Dham is directly the spiritual energy, but like the Holy Name, it can  be covered by our imperfect consciousness. So how does one uncover the  consciousness? One performs internal sadhana for purifying the mind with  the goal of getting inner vision, but one also engages the senses in  external service, attempting to realize the tiny fledgling inner vision  externally.</p>
<p>When we serve the Dham, we have to think of results  because all action is result-oriented. But we are not attached to the  external results. The real results, the real vision of the Dham, will  come internally, no matter what results there are externally. The trick  is to serve externally, see internally.</p>
<p>The idea of Vrindavan is  something like the Christians&#8217; Kingdom of God. It exists in the mind,  but demands to be reproduced, to the best of our abilities, in this  world. Since such an ideal can can never be fully realized in this  world, it must at least be made as possible as possible for people to  realize it in their minds.</p>
<p>How? By inundating the senses with love and beauty.</p>
<p>The  positivists say, “Nothing exists in mind that did not first appear in  the senses.” We agree. The only difference is that we say, the world has  a spiritual dimension that requires a different kind of processing,  through faith.</p>
<p>Our beginning point, our center, our yoga pith, is  the Holy Dham. That should be the focal point of our service. They say  that siddhi is the ability to make one&#8217;s inner vision manifest in the  outer world.</p>
<p>As you work toward that goal, the inner vision  becomes clearer and clearer. The service cleans your heart, and you  internally progress in your vision from detail to detail. That is what  this is all about.</p>
<p>Just engaging in bhajan without serving the  manifest form of Radharani’s heart as the Holy Dham is what is known in  this tradition as <em>phalgu vairagya</em>.</p>

<p>Ramesh Baba  is continuing his campaign to stop the blasting in the Braj hills. He  and his large group of followers will be surrounding the District  Magistrate&#8217;s offices in Mathura, complaining that he has not done enough  to stop it.</p>
<p>A word should be said here about Ramesh Baba, or  Sriji Baba. You can read about him at www.brajdhamsewa.org. He is a  Nimbarka sadhu, a great kirtan singer and speaker of Hari katha. He is  the single most important force for ecology and the preservation of  Braj&#8217;s natural heritage.</p>
<p>Though he is agitating for the  purification of the Yamuna and the declaring of the entire Braj area as a  green belt, currently his main issue is the mining of the Braj  hills&#8211;thankfully not Barsana, Nandagaon or Govardhan, but other similar  hills in the chaurasi kos area.</p>
<p>Ramesh Baba has felt that the  people of Vrindavan and Mathura do not give enough importance to his  issues and has written that &#8220;Braj is more than just Vrindavan or  Mathura.&#8221; For him to understand and support Vrindavan issues requires  that we also recognize and support the issues that are important to him.</p>
<p>The fact is that he has the largest support base of any sadhu  interested in these issues in Vrindavan, so his help, even if only in  words, is almost an absolute necessity. Ideally, we should find a way of  joining forces by creating a publications, websites and public  relations efforts that deal with the entire gamut of environmental  issues that Braja Dham faces.</p>
<p>So this request is for those who  are in Vrindavan on the 10th to find their way to the DM&#8217;s office and  participate in this event.</p>
<hr />
<span>(2) Feb. 17.</span></p>
<p>A big meeting of sants and sadhus at the Kumbha Mela in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>I  should mention here that there has been quite a bit of work behind the  scenes here, for which Paramadvaiti Maharaj in particular is  responsible. First of all, when in Hyderabad for the Dharmacharya  conference there, at which Dayananda Saraswati presided, he met one of  the top men in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Ashok Singhal. That led to a  meeting the day before yesterday in Delhi, with Singhal and Champat Ray,  the joint secretary. Sevak Sharanji was also there.</p>
<p>The VHP is a <em>very</em> big deal. In an earlier event on the day after the Global kirtan,  several members of the RSS (Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangha), a related  organization. These people are very disciplined and very active.</p>
<p>First  of all, the VHP leadership gave a sympathetic ear to the situation in  Vrindavan and suggested that the Vrindavan sadhus be petitioned as far  as possible and made aware of the matters related to the bridge and  preservation of Vrindavan&#8217;s heritage.</p>
<p>It appears that they will  be in Vrindavan on the 17th and will help to promote the matter at this  Dharmacharya conference. So this is a very important event.</p>
<p>Here is a translation of the announcement in the Vrindavan newspaper (Amar Ujala) of Feb. 1, 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>The Religious Leaders will meet on Feb. 17 at the Kumbha Mela</h2>
<h3>The saints and sadhus will share ideas about how to protect the Sanatan Dharma</h3>
<p><strong>They will discuss how to increase cow protection and the rebuilding of the Ram temple [in Ayodhya]</p>
<p>Emphasis will be put on giving the Kumbha Mela government status</strong></p>
<p>This  year at the Kumbha Mela in Vrindavan, leaders of the Vaishnava  sampradayas will discuss a dozen topics related to the protection of  Sanatan Dharma. Along with issues related to the Yamuna and the  mountains of Braj, they will also freely discuss cow protection and the  rebuilding of the Ram temple [in Ayodhya].</p>
<p>Before the Kumbha Mela  in Haridwar, representatives of the various maths, etc., will hold an  assembly in Vrindavan on February 17. The Vaishnava acharyas have made  many proposals concerning the preservation of Hindu symbols and dignity.  The pollution of the Yamuna River, the building of the Ram temple in  Ayodhya, the preservation of the Kumbha Mela grounds [by the Yamuna in  Vrindavan] and giving the Kumbha special government protected status,  declaring the entire 84-kos Braja area a green belt, mending pilgrimage  sites in Braj, protecting heritage sites from the &#8220;land-Mafia&#8221; are some  of the issues that will be debated at the meeting by the religious  leaders.</p>
<p>Besides stopping the blind frenetic development that is  going on in Vrindavan, Govardhan and Barsana, with the building of  multistoried buildings, etc., it will be proposed that the illegal  mining be stopped in the mountains throughout entire area of Braja,  parts of which are in Rajasthan, Haryana and U.P., which was witness to  Krishna&#8217;s pastimes and has its ghats on the Yamuna.</p>
<p>It should be  noted here, with respect to the pollution in the Yamuna, that many  sadhus refused to bathe in the holy river on the day of Shahi Snan (Jan.  30) and notified the government of their displeasure at the situation.</p>
<p>[The  promise had been made that a large amount of Ganga water would be  diverted to the Yamuna to make the water clear on the day of this  important bath, but the amount was insufficient. The DM absolved himself  of any blame, but whatever happened, the dirt in the water was too  great to be cleansed even by the addition of Ganges. As an eye witness, I  can say that there was little difference between the Yamuna on Jan. 4  and Jan 30. I rather doubt that the water was diverted as promised.]</p>
<p>Vishwa  Hindu Parishad district captain Harihar Sharma said that they expect  Jagadguru Shankaracharya, Jagadguru Nimbarkacharya, Mahanta Nritya Gopal  Das of the main encampment in Ayodhya, Sant Jnana Das of the Akhila  Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, Swami Chinmayananda, Swami Jnanananda, Sadhvi  Ritambhara, Vallabhacharya Vallabha Ray Goswami, etc., to be present.</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless  to say, the issues that Ramesh Baba holds dear are prominent on this  list. This shows clearly that supporting him is an essential part of  making sure that the issues of Vrindavan get a fair hearing at this  meeting. The general issues that are supported by Ramesh Baba are the  same as ours, so there should be no controversy, but he has let it be  known that he expects support for his pet issues from us.</p>
<p>I do  not think that it is too much for him to ask, and I therefore ask anyone  who is in the Vrindavan area to go to Mathura on the 10th to join his  demonstration, and again on the 17th to the Kumbha Mela to press for the  bridge issue and the specific problems of Vrindavan to be addressed at  the Dharmacharya Conference.</p>
<p>One other thing: It is clear that  many people still do not understood what is at stake in the bridge  issue. Many people think that its purpose is to help the pilgrims make  the parikrama. They do not realize that it is being built for cars,  trucks, buses, tempos and motorcycles, not people. If Ramesh Baba wants  Braj to be declared a green belt, let us start by declaring the  Parikrama Marg a green belt of protection around Vrindavan town and its  temples and lila sthalis.</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p>Just to show  that the issue is not dead: From the same issue of the Amar Ujjala, the  following article was published just beside the one above quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bhagavatacharya  Haraprasad Shastri declared his opposition to the PIL leading to the  stoppage of the half-moon bridge over the Yamuna and called it a  conspiracy. In an announcement made on Sunday, Shastriji said that the  building of the bridge would help those who want to do the parikrama and  that one person from outside had made use of people in Vrindavan to  achieve that end.</p></blockquote>
<p>This reference is to J.P.S. Gill who  is a Panjabi Sikh and lives in the old Bharatpur temple on Keshi Ghat  and is an opponent of the bridge. But this accusation is entirely false  and needs to be countered. Gill is not making any puppets in Vrindavan  dance. Those who oppose this bridge oppose it because it is wrongheaded  and destructive. It will NOT help those who want to do parikrama. It is  only meant to facilitate and increase vehicle traffic, to the DETRIMENT  of those doing parikrama. Besides which, it will increase pollution and  environmental degradation. It must be stopped.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are a couple of photos from the January 30 kirtan at Keshi Ghat.  The high point for me certainly came with Shyam Das&#8217;s kirtan after the  arti ceremony itself. A very sophisticated and moving performance, done  under the lights, with floating deepas speckling the darkness in the  background. It felt like a campfire, but very intimate and very  transcendental, with a small but enthusiastic group in the audience.</p>
<p>There  were many participants throughout the day, particularly featuring  members of the Vrinda organization. Notable was a very enthusiastic  kirtan led by Deenabandhuji, who is the main source for the pictures  here. Ahindra came from Iskcon with his group in  the afternoon, and  provided another patented Ahindra kirtan, which drew many people on the  steps. On the whole a very enjoyable day.</p>
<div>Krishnadevata  Dasi must be commended for organizing the global kirtan effort, which  brought together devotees at more than 230 sites around the world. Her  Facebook page is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=245684587045&amp;ref=search&amp;sid=1622852566.4131406006..1">here</a> and the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.worldprayerandkirtanday.com">Global Kirtan Webpage</a> is also available for further information.</p>

Many  people were walking through Keshi Ghat on parikrama, as this was one of  the Kumbha Mela Shahi Snanas. Some of them stopped to listen and enjoy  the kirtan.</p>

Paramadvaiti  Maharaj is the steadiest and most consistent voice for sanity in  Gaudiya Vaishnavism, at least from the social and institutional  standpoint. His disciples are committed, humble and enthusiastic. A  great credit to him and I offer them all my obeisance.</div>

<p>Things  are quieting down a bit, as expected, but I hope that the concern for  Vrindavan&#8217;s future will not abate. The petitions still need signing, so  please do not neglect that aspect of things.</p>

<div>More stuff here: <a href="http://yvhf.wordpress.com/">Yamuna Vrindavan Heritage Foundation</a>.  Please note the posters that are downloadable for printing. This site  has many pictures which make a truly excellent slideshow presentation.  It shows Vrindavan as it was 20 years ago, as it is now.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Please take the time to read the important comments from authorities</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We shall do the needful so that Vrindavan will  be restored. And Yamuna Ji will be without dirt and black water. We  don&#8217;t want a bridge in front of Keshi Gath. My Gurudev lived 30 years in  Vrindavan. It is our duty to insist that all this will be done.  Even  we can put more water from the Ganges to increase the Yamuna&#8217;s flow. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Doctor Pandiya, Head of Gayatri Parivar</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">K.P.S. Gill is a very capable man. Tell him  that I will give any support I can against the bridge and to bring the  Yamuna back to Vrindavan. Pancha Gauda Prabhu and Dina Bandhu should  head up our campaign and we will send it all in the name of the Indian  devotees of Iskcon.  If we help in this way Mr. Gill will have even more  strength in his efforts. We will join the Braj Vrindavan Heritage  Alliance and let us all work together for this noble goal.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sripad Gopal Krishna Swami, Iskcon</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All the babas will support. Jay prakash  company who has started the bridge without previous design of any agency  are also involved with some Ganga dham project. Vrindavan has to be  protected. It is our sacred duty.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sohambaba &#8211; Mahamandalesvara of Juna Akara</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I will move every bit of support possible that Vrindavan will come to the original beauty with restored ghats.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">She is our own mother Yamuna Maharani. Whoever does not take care of their mother is doomed.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Purusottama Jeeyar Maharaj &#8211; Jagadguru of Sri Rangam Ramanujacarya</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Please tell Mr. KPS Gill to contact me for any help to save Vrindavan.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Our Hindu pilgrimage sites have to be glories.  Spotless. Examples for the country and the world. People come here to  Haridvar to fill themselves with spiritual energy to be good people in  their lifes. Thus these dhamas are treasures of uncalculate value.  Greatest pain and expenditure must be taken to give the world Vrindavan  Dham as beautiful as Hrishikesh and Haridvara. Please all of you see it  done.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I am over 80 now and this was my 5th Kumbha  Mela I was involved with. Nobody should say I can&#8217;t do it anymore or  there are no experts or lack of money. India is quite capable of showing  to the world what the greatest treasure of our country the teachings of  Lord Krishna mean to us. Vrindavan means Krishna like Haridvara means  Siva and Vishnu. Ayodya means Lord Ram. Which other country in the world  has a history which has so much to offer to the world. We should be  proud to use all our skills and modern tools as well to let our love to  our culture be shown. Vande Mataram.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Ram Murti Veer State Minister &#8211; Contract Labor Board Uttrakhand</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We have to protect Hinduism against the abuse and neglect in Vrindavan.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I will study the details to join the struggle  against this situation. Vrindavan is a place which has great importance.  The administration has to respond to the health hazard and the cultural  loss created by the neglect of the urgent issues such as a clean  unobstructed Yamuna River.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Swami Dayananda Sarasvati</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We have to get together immediately in Vrindavan. I will get many more friends to join the action against the bridge.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Also Sri Ravi Shankar will help as soon as he  returns to India. He loves Yamunaji and is into full action to clean our  sacred life giving river.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I was not aware of the situation.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Swatantrananda Swami &#8211; friend of Sri Ravi Shankar</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Our Beautiful Vrindavan has to be protected at any cost.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And that means many changes which are long overdue.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Parking, traffic free zones and cleaning up  Yamunaji from all garbage and black water. Only sadhu unity will bring  about a fast result in this respect .</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Hamsananda Swami &#8211; from AIM for Seva</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">To oppose the bridge in front of Keshi Gath is  our duty, but this will not be possible in the style of Mahatma Gandhi,  because this administration is not interested in religious  sentiments&#8230;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The only thing of importance to them is money, because of this they are creating such a disaster.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I want the Yamuna to flow in front of Vrindavan again, with stairs on both sides as in Haridwar.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Most important is that the water of the Yamuna  should be clean, this is the duty of every Brajavasi. We cannot live  with contaminated water. I remember the first time I arrived in  Vrindavana; at that time the waters of the Yamuna were completely clean.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Continue in this valiant fight, for through it  you will surely attract the benediction of Radharani. I am just leaving  the hospital, but from my bed I say to you &#8220;Unite in the fight for the  cause of Vrindavan.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Mohan Sri Shashi Mohan Das ji Maharaj &#8211; Sri Nagaraindra Sikha Mani Kunja Trust</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>

<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Returning the Yamuna to the old ghats of Vrindavan</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> via a channel will be easy and will result in a beautiful ghat area that attracts and can accommodate many visitors.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. A development plan for Vrindavan that includes </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>protection of the old town</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> can result in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>economic growth</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>beauty and efficient flow of traffic.</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3. Current development and infrastructure plans (or lack thereof) are posing greater risks to Vrindavan&#8217;s people and environment every day and therefore </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>the time to help create and implement alternative plans is NOW.</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We invite you to express your opinion in these matters by participating in the Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance, which meets weekly. Meeting information and public online forums for discussing the heritage, development and environment of Vrindavan can be found at </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="http://www.bvhalliance.org/">www.bvhalliance.org </a></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">and </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="http://yvhf.wordpress.com/">yvhf.wordpress.com</a></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This letter is addressed to all of the following: The President, Chief Minister, Chief Justice of India and Political Party Leaders, the Mathura Vrindavan Development Authority, The District Magistrate of Mathura, the ADM, Chairman of the Municipal Council and its members, State and National Government Executive Officers and concerned citizens.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Every one of you is responsible for providing your people with proper waste disposal, sewage and rain and storm water management, water supply, river action plans, public works, security, traffic, planning, tourism, commerce, and local pradhans. With all respect, let me make a few observations for the benefit of your children and grandchildren regarding the heritage of Sri Vrindavan and Braj Mandal:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We need not reiterate the importance of the heritage of Braj; it is known worldwide and attracts millions of tourists and pilgrims each year. Thus it is of utmost importance both for heritage integrity and the continued prosperity of the area that the following issues be addressed: </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>returning the Yamuna to the ghats of Vrindavan, a regulated plan for preserving Vrindavan&#8217;s heritage areas that embraces continued economic growth, and a discussion on why such plans must be formulated and implemented immediately.</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>The Advantage of Returning the Yamuna to the Original Ghats of Vrindavan:</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">To have a beautiful historical monument like the ghats, especially the Keshi ghat, is an extraordinary gift. Beautiful structures like this are also called landmarks, because once you have seen them you can never forget them. They are very rare and they remind us of some glorious past. Nothing should obstruct the vision to see such monuments, not even other beautiful buildings. The Vrindavan skyline on the Yamuna was the actual entrance door to Vrindavan at a time when people used to arrive by boat from Mathura.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The debris that has been dumped over the ghats over many years has become the base of the parikrama motorway in front of Vrindavan&#8217;s ghats. It undoubtedly represents certain practical features for those who drive along this motorway, but at what cost? First of all, the beauty of Vridavan&#8217;s sandstone ghats has been needlessly marred. Second, the Yamuna and thus sweet water has been sent farther away from Vrindavan. Third, peaceful movement has become impossible for yatris due to the abundance of motorized vehicles, dirt, black nalis, and business encroachments. In addition to all of this, the artificial debris encroachment is continuously utilized as a garbage dump. Since the whole road is illegal dumping, the public has become apathetic and has decided to keep throwing waste and constructing shops in this precious and sacred area.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Thus deprived of its natural beauty, the most picturesque part of Vrindavan has become a dumping ground. It has also become a breeding ground for many dangerous diseases. In recent years, it has even become the toilet of Vrindavan. Regardless of what plan is finally chosen, the court has ruled that sewage water is not allowed to go into the Yamuna. Finally there was a sane decision to protect the citizens from contamination.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We therefore suggest that Jai Prakash Associates, Ltd. draft a plan for bringing the Yamuna back to the ghats. If they are unable to do so, a group of engineers specializing in canal construction can be called upon. Illegal encroachments will have to be removed, but the universal gain will be great and those who face losses can be compensated.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If  we can bring the Yamuna back to the ghats via a channel at least 10 meters wide and deep enough that typical Yamuna boats can navigate upon it, we would have a boating place more lovely than the canals of Venice, Italy, which millions of people go to see yearly. A restored riverfront via a channel that runs water to the old ghats would instantly turn Vrindavan into one of the most beautiful medieval cities of the world. Additionally, the ghats can be safely extended where the movements of large masses of people are obstructed and thus also be made safe for use by people with disabilities. Since Vrindavan is a city with a living spiritual culture where people come by the millions to see Banke Bihari, Radha Raman, Radha Damodar and the other famous deities, a properly cared-for Vrindavan could become an international showcase for architectural beauty, saintliness, devotion and hygiene.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Such a display of respect for Vrindavan&#8217;s heritage and culture, along with a sensible plan for managing the town&#8217;s infrastructure, will continue to draw even more pilgrims and visitors to the city most associated with Sri Krishna. A half moon flyover could never do this. It will only further mar the view of the town and the river and allow tourists to literally bypass the heart of Vrindavan without stopping or spending money there.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>A Plan for Growth that Respects Heritage:</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Vrindavan needs a comprehensive plan that addresses the need to preserve the sacred character of the town that is so dear to pilgrims and tourists while also allowing Vrindavan to prosper as it receives all of these visitors.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If you think about it carefully, we don&#8217;t need and we don&#8217;t want to have motor vehicles on the steps of the ghats. It is worth considering that in the classical cities and medieval towns and villages of Europe, as well as in settlements in other parts of the world where the cities are not that old, the center of town, the riverfronts and the landmarks are intensely protected and kept traffic free; only pedestrians are allowed. Therefore, in addition to the plans for ghat restoration that include extended walkways as mentioned above, here are a few other suggestions:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The old town of Vrindavan should be designated as a heritage area and motor vehicles should not be allowed inside. There should be strict guidelines in place to retain the heritage architecture of the buildings and only original materials such as sandstone should be used in restoration work. Thus, uniformity will be achieved, creating a charm more alluring than any easy access motorway or today&#8217;s often traffic-jammed lanes could offer.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Access to these areas would still be incredibly easy. We propose that the town accomplish the two objectives of traffic accommodation and environmental beautification simultaneously by creating a grove of original Braj trees on the other side of the Yamuna and making a parking area behind that grove. Visitors could then enter Vrindavan over the existing pontoon bridge or over an additional pontoon bridge established near Madan Mohan Mandir. Perhaps even a pedestrian bridge along the lines of the Laxman Jula in Rishikesh would work well. The old town can then be visited either by cycle rickshaw or on foot; motorized vehicles will be prohibited. Exceptions would be made for emergency vehicles and night delivery of goods.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The area of the old town is small, and it is very likely that the setup We have just proposed would provide for faster transport than the system in place today; traffic is often at a complete standstill because the roads cannot handle the large vehicles that travel upon them. Thus, whether considering the issue as one of heritage protection or of traffic efficiency, our proposed plan is the only sensible one. The only hurdle is educating the public about the efficiency of such a setup, making the very points we have brought to your attention here.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>A Discussion on the Importance of Taking Immediate Action:</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It is of utmost importance that these long term plans for promoting growth while respecting heritage be formulated and implemented immediately because the current situation allows time neither for any one of you as leaders or any one of us as citizens to delay. The continued atrophy of Vrindavan&#8217;s glory caused by irresponsible development must be stopped. If it is not stopped, health hazards, environmental damage and loss of livelihood greater than that occurring at present awaits Vrindavan. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Current actions being taken in the name of development for Vrindavan are unplanned and lack an overall vision for the future of the town and its residents. There is talk of developing tourism and a master plan for Braj tourism in Uttar Pradesh has been formulated. However, officials have not considered the main impetus for tourists, Indian and foreign alike, to make the trip to Braj mandal. The trip is made to experience the culture of a place famed for its greenery and ancient temples. All current initiatives seem to act to the detriment of this cultural image that attracts so many people. The India Ministry of Tourism&#8217;s &#8220;Incredible India&#8221; campaign does a beautiful job of marketing the things that draw people to the country&#8217;s tourism destinations. Browse through their advertisements and website and you will see that pristine heritage unobstructed by modern development is what &#8220;sells.&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">There is a need not only for ghat restoration and heritage protection, but also for local infrastructure and consideration for human health.  Right now, Vrindavan is not a city. It is a concrete slum. Building debris litters the broken streets everywhere. The entire town suffers from aesthetic degradation. While the rest of the world is trying to take combustible engines and pollution out of their towns, Vrindavan is trying to bring them in! This is not only an unappealing occurrence that complicates the traffic of this small-laned town. It also contributes to air and water pollution.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Structures built in the Yamuna, such as the illegal landfill being used to construct the contested flyover in front of Keshi ghat, are restricting the river&#8217;s already pathetic flow. Stagnant sewage thus slowly seeps into the groundwater to poison the people. Such water is also the breeding ground of several water borne diseases, including dengue, malaria, diarrhea and dysentery. We reiterate: regardless of what plan is finally chosen, the court has ruled that sewage water is not allowed to go into the Yamuna. Therefore it is imperative that untreated sewage immediately stop being dumped into the Yamuna and all constructions in the river be undertaken with plans to obstruct the river&#8217;s flow as little as possible.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Let us wake up!  No more indifference or passivity. Vrindavan could be clean and organized like any beautiful heritage city in Europe or Singapore. We are the hosts to the pilgrims coming to Braj from everywhere around the world. Who can take action? Who can keep up a standard when administrators change all the time? A permanent forum with the power to protect Braj is necessary which includes a special administration of true welfare workers who will oversee development projects in the area.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Please do what YOU can do. We did our duty by bringing this to your attention. Now it is your duty to act.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Please:</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Save Vrindavan Dham from the flyover in the Yamuna.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Participate in the planning and execution of sensible, holistic development plans.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Give your support to gain World Heritage status for Braj and Vrindavan Dham.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Demand that no more garbage or sewage flows into Yamunaji. If not we are slowly killing our wells and citizens.</span></li>
</ul>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We may or may not stop the bridge, but as Vaishnavas we are not attached to the results of our action. We neither lose enthusiasm for doing the right thing when we fail to achieve the results we sought, nor do we stop and rest on our laurels when we do reach our goals. Seva to the Divine Couple is infinite.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The degradation of the Vrindavan environment has been going on for some time, but without cars or accumulations of garbage, it was somewhat tolerable. We could live with it and still appreciate the underlying transcendental atmosphere.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The exponential increase of pilgrims over the past decade has meant that the environmental degradation is also increasing apace. It has also meant that a taste for materialism has crept into the spirit of the people, with all that this entails. The sum result is that it is getting harder and harder to see or feel the sacred power of Vrindavan. Service to the Dham means perceiving and making manifest that sacred power. That is prema.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We are actually happy that devotees are coming to Braj, but we have to participate in the process of development so that we get the Vrindavan WE want. By saying that, I don&#8217;t mean that we are going to shove some ideas down the Brajvasis&#8217; throats. It is theirs first and only ours by adoption.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">But we do have the right to _imagine_ Vrindavan in terms of its sacred character and think how that aspect of the town can be preserved and enhanced. That is service to the Dham and to the Divine Couple. Make no mistake about it. Serving the Dham is sakshat seva, a most powerful sadhana, and most fortunate are they who are given the opportunity to engage in it.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">One important thing is that Vrindavan should be understood in terms of Madhurya, not Aishwarya. Ideas like Krishna Disneyworld, 100-foot Vishnu statues and other crass compromises with materialism should be opposed at all costs. Any malls or commercial centers catering exclusively to materialistic attitudes should be kept on the periphery of the town. Attempts at creating and developing green public spaces like Seva Kunj and Nidhivan, etc., the Parikrama Marg and the Yamuna flood plains should be encouraged.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Vrindavan is in the mind first. It is, as someone pointed out, Radha&#8217;s mind. However, it does not exist only in the mind, but also in the senses. Recreating the mind&#8217;s Vrindavan, even in the circumstances of the age, means engaging all the senses in the service of the Divine Couple.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Case :</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">- PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION (PIL) No. &#8211; 2593 of 2010</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Petitioner :</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">- Madhu Mangal Shukla</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Respondent :</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">- Union Of India Thru. Secr. Ministry Of Environment &amp; Others</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Petitioner Counsel :</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">- A. Chaturvedi,Amit Verma,G.N. Verma</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Respondent Counsel :</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">- A.S.G.I.,C.S.C. (2010/2052),D.S. Chauhan</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hon&#8217;ble Vijay Manohar Sahai,J.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hon&#8217;ble Virendra Kumar Dixit,J.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Statement has been made by Sri A. Chaturvedi learned counsel for the petitioner that Shri G.N. Verma Senior Counsel has withdrawn from this case and he will not appear as Counsel in this writ petition. Sri A. Chaturvedi with Sri Amit Verma will only appear as Counsel for the petitioner in view of the statement made by him.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, Dr. A.K. Nigam, Additional Solicitor General of India assisted by Mr. Irfan Ali for respondent no. 1, 2, 3 and 10, Standing Counsel appearing for respondents no. 4, 5 and 6, Sri Rajesh Mishra appearing for respondent no. 7 and Sri D.S. Chauhan for respondent no. 8.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Counter affidavit may be filed within three weeks thereafter rejoinder affidavit may be filed within one week. The petitioner shall take steps to serve notice by Registered Post as well as Dasti notice within a week.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It has been argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that Vrindavan has its religious importance and along the river Yamuna there is Panchkosi Parikrama Marg which passes through the Ghats situated on the banks of river Yamuna. The pilgrims do parikrama on their feet as well as by crawling on the Parikrama Marg to worship Lord Krishna. That some persons in collusion with the authorities had encroached the bank of river Yamuna by raising construction and making their houses, ashrams, hotels etc. between the Ghat and river Yamuna along the Parikrama Marg in the flood plain area. That the land over which these illegal constructions have been raised, in fact is a nazul land. That the drains and sewerage of the aforesaid area falls in river Yamuna making the river unfit for drinking, washing and bathing purposes. It is further submitted that the garbage of the city also being dumped in the aforesaid ghats. That allowing the constructions which is being raised on the ground that the same is in the interest of public, question still remains whether interest of ecology and environment and right to the citizens guaranteed under article 21 of Constitution of India would have priority over the interest of public. It is also submitted that the respondents had started construction of bridge along the river Yamuna which starts from Shringarvat and ends in Badikunj (Keshi Ghat). The aforesaid constructions have been started without obtaining No Objection Certificate from the Ministry of Environment for the construction of bridge over river Yamuna that too not across the river but along the river bank. That Vrindavan comes under the Taj Trapezium Zone and the authorities had also not obtained No Objection Certificate from the Hon&#8217;ble Apex Court before starting construction. That due to construction of aforesaid bridge not only Gahats will perish but the flow of the river which has been diverted from construction of bridge will also leave only ghats from where at present river flows.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the office of the respondent no. 8 had admitted that Vrindavan Samagra Vikas Pariyojana, Tourism Master Plan of Vraj Region is yet not sanctioned and the fund for the aforesaid construction has been sanctioned by Tourism Department. That the construction work of the bridge is against the rules of the the Indian Archaeological Act and the same was stopped by District Magistrate, Mathura but the same has again started and work on the bridge is being carried out without obtaining the necessary permission from the concerned departments. It is also submitted that to permit constructions along with river amounts to breach of the statutory provision of the Environment (Protection) Act, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. Learned counsel for the Mahtura Vrindavan Development Authority urged that the authorities have given notice to the persons who are raising illegal constructions. Prima facie, it appears that no firm action has been taken by the concerned authorities to stop the illegal constructions raised between the ghats and river by local citizens. Dumping of garbage in the ghats of river Yamuna, illegal encroachments constructions on the side of bank of river, permitting raising construction of bridge along river Yamuna without being any permission from the Hon&#8217;ble the Apex Court which comes under the Taj Trapezium Zone is a serious matter. On all these aspects of the matter, a detailed counter affidavit shall be filed by the respondents.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">List for further hearing on 23.2.2010.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Until further order of the Court, the respondents are directed to stop further constructions over the bridge which is being constructed along side river Yamuna and other illegal constructions on the land which falls between the ghats and river Yamuna on both the sides and to stop dumping of garbage in river Yamuna or its bank. Respondents are further directed to ensure that no constructions are raised in the aforesaid area by any person.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Order Date :</strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">- 21.1.2010</span></div>

			<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://bvhalliance.org/about-the-injunction-against-the-construction-of-the-bridge-over-the-yamuna-by-jagadananda-das/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This news that a temporary injunction against the construction of the bridge over the Yamuna is most welcome.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We can rejoice and thank the devotees from around the world. Their massive sigh of despair has no doubt influenced the way that the karmic wheel is turning.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">More and more people have become conscious of the issue and have been deeply affected emotionally at the thought of the wanton desecration and destruction of our beloved Vrindavan Dham.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">But we are far from winning this war. It is only lull, a break, a little bit of time to mobilize our forces for the even greater obstacles that need to be overcome.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This war will not be won by mind vibrations only, nor even by Harinam alone. It will require convincing people on a massive scale in India and around the world.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">When we started in Krishna consciousness so many years ago, we thought that the whole world would turn to Krishna in a very short time. We were so enthusiastic and convinced. And yet, it did not take very long for us to see how strong Maya is and how she can undermine our efforts in so many ways.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The biggest weapon Maya has is to weaken our faith and make us passive. Maya will say, &#8220;God is in control. He has no need of your seva. He has already determined the results. You only need to be a detached and passive observer.&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I say that this is Mayavada philosophy. Devotees take pleasure in serving and enjoy the apparent challenge that comes when they have to dig deeper into themselves and their practice to find the strength and intelligence to serve in the ways that Krishna asks them to serve.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Now this is really a very amazing moment in the history of the Krishna Consciousness Movement.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This issue cuts across _all_ sampradayika lines. Whether you belong to Iskcon, the Gaudiya Math, another Vaishnava parampara, or even to any Hindu sampradaya&#8230; it goes beyond even those who have purely religious interests and extends to all who are into the protection of the environment and that of human cultural and historical heritage.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">As such, it can and should take us out of our tiny parochial universes and make us see how we share common values with so many others.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It can and should remind us that we need to put aside our petty egoisms about being the best or purest or most representative of Krishna or Mahaprabhu, or God Himself, and work together to achieve a goal that is both concrete and realizable.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I will say that again: This is a goal that is concrete and realizable.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Making everyone into Mahaprabhu&#8217;s bhakta may or may not be. Making everyone recognize Srila Prabhupada as the Yuga Acharya may or may not be. All of our biggest goals have a potential date of realization so far in the future that they are, in a sense, neither concrete nor realizable.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">But this is a goal that is both concrete and realizable.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Not only that, but it can be seen as a stepping stone to our higher and more longterm goals, for _all_ of us.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If Vrindavan is preserved as a sacred place, will that not inspire people from India and around the world to see it a source of inspiration, and to chant the Holy Names and recognize the saints who lived and worshiped here as preceptors of a truly beautiful and valuable mode of religious thought and practice?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And if the Yamuna is preserved as a sacred river, will that not function as an important stepping stone to a return to the consciousness of the sacred nature of the world as the manifestation of God&#8217;s energies? Is a pure and clean Yamuna that can be bathed not an essential brick in the reconstruction of the Dham as a sacred land?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And if we accomplish these things, will not Iskcon, the Gaudiya Math, all the Gaudiya vamshas and parivars, all the Vaishnava sampradayas, all Hindu sampradayas, all religions and environmental groups, indeed all human beings, not benefit from the achievement?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">John Donne said that no man is an island. Neither is any sampradaya. This is a worthy goal for all of us and we must work together to do whatever is necessary to achieve it.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This is a goal for which the tools that we have already become trained are so eminently useful, whether it is writing, speaking, convincing the public, doing the footwork, going from door to door, creating enthusiasm, etc.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So please, keep on using the tools at your disposition to network, to publicize the issue, to push forward the letter writing and petition work.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We will win this war only on the field of public opinion and that is where we must descend and do battle. We must inundate all the offices of responsible parties, of influential people, with letters that let them know the way we feel. Give concrete ideas and proposals, but never forget the essential:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Vrindavan is OUR sacred place and we will not allow shortsighted business or commercial interests destroy it.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Jai Radhe, Jai Radhe!!</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This map is based upon the popular slogan of UN &#8220;Development without Destruction&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The area in the circle requires to be declared as Vrindavan heritage zone.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Previously the area between Vrindavan and Delhi Agra road was declared Greenbelt.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">That has to be changed to the agriculture land on the other side of the yamuna opposite to Vrindavan. The supposed to be green belt is being developed from Chaitanya Bihar up to the main road.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The plan to develop the Kumbha mela ground into a human settlement for ashrams and low cost housing is the same corrupt project which destroyed the previous green belt.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The new road around Vrindavan and the roads on the Kumbha mela site tell the clear story what the developers are screaming.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And on the other side of the Yamuna the same is planned after the bridge will be finished.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">There will be no more green Vrindavan if we will not stop this process now.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The suggestion was to create a rail/road bridge and barrage over the Yamuna outside of the circle leaving space for development and preservation.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Sri Vraja Mandala, consisting of twelve forests over an area of eighty-four square miles, is the Supreme Abode of Lord Krsna manifest within the material world for the spiritual benediction of all souls. Five thousand years ago, Lord Krsna, whom the most ancient scriptures of world, the Vedas, reveal as the Highest Manifestation of Godhead, enjoyed His transcendental pastimes throughout this Divine Land. He appeared in Gokula, near Mathura, at early age moved to Nandgrama, and throughout Sri Vraja Mandala displayed His unlimited pastimes in the company of His intimate associates. These transcendental pastimes continue to this day, for the Vedas declare that Sri Krsna never leaves Vraja, His Supreme Abode, for even just one moment. With vibrant hope to realize and enter those pastimes, to this day from every country in the world, from all castes and creeds, devotees travel to Sri Vraja Mandala. The touch of this Divine Abode, even to this day, evokes devotion within all souls, and by this devotion the Supreme Lord is revealed within the heart. In this way, Sri Vraja Mandala is known as Cintämaëi-Dhäma, the place where all desires are fulfilled by the Grace of the Supreme Lord.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sri Vraja Mandala: A Region of Special Administration</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Development within Sri Vraja Mandala should be in accordance with the intrinsic spiritual quality of this Transcendental Abode. This paper outlines how this may be attained.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. The complete area of Sri Vraja Mandala should be designated as a Region of Special Administration. Pursuant to this, an especially dedicated office should be created within the UP State Government. The duties of this office would be to precisely define the boundaries of Sri Vraja Mandala. The office would oversee the protection of the spiritual heritage of Sri Vraja Mandala. The office would define and oversee suitable development for Sri Vraja Mandala.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. The Office of Sri Vraja Mandala would institute a committee of the leading spiritual personalities of Sri Vraja Mandala for close consultation in regard to the protection of the Mandala and to oversee suitable spiritual development within the Mandala.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Development Within Sri Vraja Mandala</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Divine Glories of this region are extolled in the Vedas. Therefore the development should showcase the most Ancient Heritage of India as presented in the Vedas for the edification of the National and International Community.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. Sri Vraja Mandala is the place of Sri Krsna&#8217;s rural pastimes, therefore protection of the rural environment of the region is of the highest priority.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. Thus go-raksa, cow protection, is essential.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3. Pursuant to the protection of the cows and other lifestock of the Mandala, the government may start a Veterinary College of the highest quality within the region.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4. The government may start studies, teaching, and the practical implementation of &#8216;methods of organic farming&#8217; throughout the Mandala based on ancient Vedic practices.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5. Thus land irrigation projects and the boring of tube wells to enhance the fertility of the region may be overseen.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6. Throughout Sri Vraja Mandala there are the most wonderful buildings, palaces, lakes and bathing ghats to be found, comparable to any within the whole world. A priority would be to preserve and maintain these wondrous architectural achievements. Thus new building in these locales must be carefully supervised.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7. When visiting a Holy Place, the Vedas instruct one to bathe at the ghats and perform parikrama on barefoot. Therefore special attention should be towards the purity of water at these bathing sites. The numerous parikrama paths of the Mandala should remain places of pedestrian traffic, only. They must not be developed as motorways, thus destroying their very nature and the very purpose of visiting a Vedic holy place.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8. Near to the particular holy places of Sri Vraja Mandala, overnight facilities for pilgrims may be created. In keeping with the sacred nature of the Mandala, these facilities may be simple, clean and inexpensive.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9. Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas. Thus the government may start colleges and universities within Sri Vraja Mandala teaching this wonderful and most scientific language to scholars not only of India, but scholars from all corners of the world.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">10. In the Sanskrit Universities, a special research office may be created to accumulate and preserve all available Vedic Literature from all temples and corners of India. This office may also search the world for further Vedic and Sanskrit literatures for the collection.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">11. The Vedas teach the science of Astrology. Thus a research and teaching university of this ancient science may be started in association with the Sanskrit University.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">12. The Vedas teach the medical science of Ayurveda. Presently, throughout the world the beneficial remedies of this science are becoming increasingly famous. A research and teaching university of this science may be started. Concurrently a hospital and treatment centre for this ancient Vedic science may be build.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">13. The Vedas teach the Arts of Music and Dance in unique depth and beauty. In the Mandala, colleges dedicated to the research and teaching of these arts would be instituted.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">14. Publishing Houses for the presentation and translation of the Vedas and Vedic philosophy would be instituted in Sri Vraja Mandala.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The above fourteen ideas illustrate the development of Sri Vraja Mandala as a rural area of holy pilgrimage that would showcase the Vedas and Vedic Knowledge to the national and international community. In this way, the central component of Ancient Indian Culture would be developed and illustrated to the world.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Protection of Sri Vraja Mandala</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Protection of Sri Vraja Mandala would necessarily run concordantly with the development of the Mandala as a rural area of great architectural and natural beauty that showcases the Vedas and Vedic Knowledge and Arts to the International Community.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Heavy industrial development would not take place within the Mandala.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Protection of the natural beauty of the Mandala would be of the highest priority.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Cow protection and husbandry within the Mandala of Sri Krsna&#8217;s Pastimes would be of the highest priority.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The architectural wonders of the Mandala would be protected.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Pastime Places of Sri Krsna would be researched, designated and protected.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The illicit stone mining activities within the Mandala would be stopped.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All building and roads within the Mandala would be subject to strict planning permission.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The bathing ghats, temples and kunds of the Mandala would be restored.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All the parikrama paths of the Mandala would be maintained as unpaved pedestrian walks seperate from vehicular traffic.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Mandala would be kept to the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The use of plastic packing and bags within the Mandala would be restricted.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Rubbish disposal within the Mandala would be quick, efficient and not damage the ecological rural environment.</span></li>
</ol>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The above twelve points should be added to and developed to ensure the protection of Sri Vraja Mandala. A police force especially tasked with ecological preservation of the Mandala would be trained. Educational programmes for a &#8220;Clean and Green Vraja Mandala&#8221; would be instituted. Thus the local population would be brought on board with the Governmental programmes for the development and protection of Sri Vraja Mandala.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">As India enters the era of modern economic development it is of vital importance that the Ancient Vedic Culture of India should not be destroyed. Sri Vraja Mandala is unique throughout the world and presently is becoming increasingly famous as a topmost place of holy pilgrimage, especially for the national and international community of devotees of Sri Krsna. This paper suggests a route of development for the Mandala that would preserve and present the Vedic Knowledge, Philosophy, Spirituality and Arts to the national and international community in a beautiful rural environment. Presently there is much international concern for the natural environment, which is becoming polluted by the modern industrial society. Development within Sri Vraja Mandala should showcase the Indian Government concern for the natural environment and spiritual knowledge of the Vedas for which India is renowned worldwide. In this way the status of India would be enhanced internationally. However the real consideration is service to Sri Krsna. Those fortunate souls who render devotional service in protecting and suitably developing the transcendental place of Sri Krsna&#8217;s Pastimes, Sri Vraja Mandala, will surely attract His Eternal Blessings upon themselves and their nation.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We, the undersigned, who are friends of Vrindavan and lovers of Braj culture, who are concerned about the ecological protection of Braj Mandal and the rest of the world, who want the whole world to be able to come to Vrindavan and to enhance their spiritual life by seeing the unique features of Braj Mandal, submit the following to all authorities of the Indian administration: His Excellency the President, the Honorable Prime Minister, the Honorable Chief Minister and administration of the Uttar Pradesh Government:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We request the status of World Heritage Site for the sacred city of Vrindavan. Even better than that, we would hope it could be extended to the whole Braj Mandal. This would help establish protective measures for the heritage of this unique region, considered by devotees of Krishna to be the spiritual world on earth.  With your support  for this petition, we can show UNESCO how many people in the world are eager for the welfare and carefully monitor the development of this sanctuary.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">B-5/29 Safdarjung Enclave</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">New Delhi 110 029</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Dear Sri Parsuramen ji,</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">With Vrindavan as its centre, Braj, the area between Delhi and Agra, is a fountainhead of the running stream that has spread over the length and breadth of the canvas of Indian culture. It is a home, not only to the cultural expressions centering on the Vaishnava/Krishna experience, but also to Jain and Buddhist literature, art and architecture etc. It has been a witness to Greek, Islamic and Christian cultural interaction, seamlessly integrating them into its fabric.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The creation of Vrindavan as an independent town and revenue entity in 1598 CE was Mughal Emperor Akbar&#8217;s gift to Brajvasis. With vision, dedication and service, the saints and people of Braj raised Vrindavan to the peak of its glory.  Today it is one of the most visited pilgrimage centres in India. Unfortunately, however, this popularity has also been its bane.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The rapid growth of population, both residing and visiting, has necessitated a the development of civic amenities and infrastructure. Despite the best intentions, Vrindavan is finding it hard to conserve its unique landscape and built heritage of groves, temples, kunds, river, riverside architecture, etc. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">There is no shortage of resources, agencies and funds, yet the desired results are not visible. What is missing is a comprehensive plan for this unique cultural landscape, taking into account the interlocking character of its devotional, artistic, geographic, social and economic aspects.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Therefore, we the citizens of Vrindavan request that:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. UNESCO help and participate in the planning process, so that all the relevant agencies may work synergetically, ensuring the best utilization of all available resources, and</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. that you guide us towards the process by which Vrindavan and Brajmandal can be listed by UNESCO as a world heritage site.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We look forward to working with you in this direction.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In the service of Braj-Vrindavan,</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">friends and well-wishers:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We are collecting signatures to encourage the local administration and the Indian government to secure World Heritage Status for Vrindavan Dham or, even better, for Braj Mandal.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This page has been specially created so that all the Brijvasis and friends of Vrindavan, who live around the world, can write their opinions and recommendations on this topic.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The main purpose of requesting this status is to obtain support from all sides to preserve the sanctity of the places of pilgrimage.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Vrindavan has been a place of pilgrimage for thousands of years, but since the time of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Haridas Swami, awareness of the land of Krishna&#8217;s birth and childhood was revived.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And, more recently, ever since Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj went around the world and spread the glories of Vrindavan, the number of visitors from every corner of the planet has increased. This international popularity has also boomeranged, and all the Vaishnava sampradayas are enjoying the benefits both here in India and abroad.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This means that so many people are coming here and buying flats to spend their last days in Vrindavan. The increase of traffic from Delhi and elsewhere, especially on weekends and holidays, is putting tremendous pressure on the local infrastructure, often to the detriment of Vrindavan&#8217;s sacred patrimony.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We hope that with the awarding of World Heritage Status more attention will be given to the Vrindavan&#8217;s beautiful ghats, refuse collection and disposal, black water management, and so many of the other problems that beset this unique town.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">By signing this petition, we are requesting the World Heritage Status for Vrindavan or even better, for Braj Mandal and the kind attention of all important leaders, citizens and visitors to help in any way possible.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Here is what you can do:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. Sign the petition and give further good reasons why we should increase protection for this sacred place.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. Promote the petition on Facebook, Twitter, or any other way through the internet.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3. Donate to organizations that are working for the benefit of Braj Mandal.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4. Give any help you can to make this area a place with highest ecological standards.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5. Register your email with us so we can keep you informed about developments in Braj Mandal.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Banke Bihari Lalji ki jay!</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Braj Mandal ki jay!</span></div>

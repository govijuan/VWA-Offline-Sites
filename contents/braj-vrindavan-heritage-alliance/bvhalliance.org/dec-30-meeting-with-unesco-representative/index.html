<p>The  meeting was started with a word of welcome from Sri Shrivatsa Goswami,  who appreciated Sri Parasuramenen’s agreeing to a meeting on short  notice while on a personal visit to Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa  stated that Vrindavan is unique in its natural heritage, its oral,  spiritual and cultural heritage. Its literature, dance, music, theater,  art and the approach of Bhakti, all have a distinct nature here.</p>
<p>Whilst  he was aware that for those of us who live here it is also our home and  we require the modern amenities of life, he said the aim was to find a  way that the sacred nature of Vrindavan is not lost by unplanned  urbanization. We have to consider that the local people have their needs  and requirements but must also preserve what it is that makes Vrindavan  different from any other place.</p>
<p>The existence of Vrindavan is  because of Krishna, and without Him Vrindavan would not exist. Countless  people visit Vrindavan every year because they are devoted to Krishna.  We are here to play with Krishna Sri Shrivatsa said. He appealed to Sri  Parasuramenen to bring in his and UNESCO’s expertise in giving Vrindavan  world heritage site status.</p>
<p>With this he invited Sri Parasuramenen to speak.</p>
<p>Sri  Parasuramenenji spoke of his intent in returning from Paris where he  was posted, to the land of his ancestors, India. He asked for this  posting as he wished to give back and return to his roots. His ancestors  migrated to Mauritius from Salem in Tamil Nadu in the late 1800’s. He  has always been attracted to the tradition and culture of Krishna.<br />
He  expressed his happiness in being in Vrindavan on a personal visit with  his family and for the opportunity to meet with the citizens of  Vrindavan and hear their views.</p>
<p>Sri Sewak Sharanji was the next  speaker. He said that an ever increasing number of people come here to  find Krishna. We have to save this world heritage, he said, which in  fact is a human sanctuary. Its natural heritage as well as its built  heritage, the man-made architectural sites, are unique here. The natural  heritage of Vrindavan as the place of the lila or play of Radha and  Krishna is most important. Sri Sewak Sharanji said the cultural  development must be parallel with other development. They should not  intersect, nor be in confrontation. He appealed for a plan for Vrindavan  which could be a model for all of Braj as well as for other heritage  towns.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa added here that this is where UNESCO’s  expertise in the realm of conservation and planned development for other  heritage towns and settlements would be most valued.</p>
<p>Sri  Harimohan Malviya, Director of the Vrindavan Research Institute (VRI)  spoke next. He spoke of his sadness at the lack of preservation of the  heritage sites of the great literary geniuses of India, Surdas, Tansen,  and many others who lived and drew their inspiration from Braj. Although  a living centre for Education, Literature and Culture, the Sahitya  Dharma of Braj, its literary tradition is becoming extinct. He made an  appeal that UNESCO’s programs for culture be implemented here. He asked  that the monuments connected to the great litterateurs of Braj be  restored. Sri Parasuramen said that UNESCO will immediately assist in  this venture.</p>
<p>Sri Malaviya also informed that VRI is planning to  hold a multi-disciplinary international conference on the Heritage of  Braj in the coming year and also begining an ambitious project on  preparing an Encyclopeadia of Braj Culture, a collaborative effort of  international scholarship.</p>
<p>Sri Atul Sharma of Gurgaon spoke  next. He stated that the 80 percent of the population of this country,  which is Hindu, lacks a sanctified space for worship. He spoke of  developing proper habitats and shelters for all and the need to create a  slum free environment here in this most holy of holy places for Hindus.</p>
<p>Sri Radhakrishna Pathak spoke next. He too appealed that the  original fabric and roots of Vrindavan be preserved. Vrindavan had its  own municipality since 1865 and he spoke of the new amalgamation of the  muncipality here in Vrindavan with the one in Mathura as a great  mistake.</p>
<p>Sri Parasuramenen said that is a very important mission  of UNESCO to make the intangible cultural traditions of a place  compatible with its tangible physical realities. UNESCO advocates  development and conservation of heritage and promotes eco-tourism.</p>
<p>Sri  Udayan Sharma next warned that the new circular road (bridge) within  the Yamuna stream is against the principles of Vastu. This Keshi Ghat  area, he said, is an important vastu centre for the peninsular nature of  Vrindavan. The bridge will severely affect the vastu of Braj and India.</p>
<p>He said that the local landowners have been cheated of land by  developers from outside who are not acting as stakeholders but are  developing urban housing projects only for personal profit.</p>
<p>He  appealed for a minimum common program to halt the buying of land from  locals as has been done in Uttaranchal. These people do not have a  concept that Braj and Vrindavan have a special global presence.</p>
<p>He  also said that the political development linking the civic bodies of  Mathura and Vrindavan would spoil things further. If Vrindavan is  considered only a small appendage its interests will suffer.</p>
<p>Swami  Sewak Sharan added that it would not only be a historic, administrative  wrong move, but a cultural disaster as well. Mathura from time  immemorial has been representing the urban-city culture, whereas  Vrindavan had been till now a model of natural settlement  (vana-samskriti) and natural heritage.</p>
<p>Sri Pawan and Sri  Shrivatsa said that there was no anti-government attitude here. But the  local voices should always have a say in any developments here.</p>
<p>Sri  Paramadvaiti Swami said this tradition comes from the Vedas. Like the  Vatican, Vrindavan is the centre for those who follow the Vedic  religion. The tradition and culture systems have been preserved here for  thousands of years by the kings of ancient India.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  the political parties have not been sincere or serious to involve local  people in conserving this tradition. All decisions are made by  engineers and experts outside of Braj without a view to preserving the  traditions. If we lose our tradition we lose everything he said, The  government must consult with the local people before they do anything.</p>
<p>Yamuna  and Tulasi are mentioned in the scriptural books as essential for  Krishna‘s presence. This is our faith, he said, so we need to preserve  the Yamuna and the vanas.<br />
Paramadvaita Maharaj also said that tourism  and agriculture are the two most important means of livelihood here.  People come to see the Yamuna, meet saints, and have darshan at the  temples. The businessmen have thrived from this tourism, but the urban  development has led to destruction of both these sites and of the  agricultural tradition.</p>
<p>Developers are furthermore exploiting  the sentiments of the people who come here to live, to be close to the  temples of their faith or to retire and even die here.<br />
More people  are coming than ever before and more will come. So development has to be  planned. Sewage systems don’t exist—all the sewage goes into the  Yamuna. There has to be planned infrastructure. We need the citizens to  unite. We need UNESCO’s intervention he said.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa spoke  of the urgency of having a comprehensive planning process in the  Vrindavan spirit. We are losing good will towards Vrindavan, he said, as  the present government in UP has been very generous in making a huge  grant for developing Vrindavan and Braj. But the lack of a blueprint or  good decisions by the local administration and the failure to utilize  this interest properly is a waste of the generous aid that is being  offered.</p>
<p>As a group, Sri Shrivatsa said, we want the cooperation  and guidance of UNESCO. UNESCO’s efforts for the Taj, Hampi  (Vijaynagar), etc., have made them what they are today—World Heritage  Sites. He makes this appeal on behalf of Vrindavan; in fact on behalf of  all Brajvasis, on behalf of all of Braj Mandala, which is one unit. He  appealed to Sri Parasuramenen to help this movement gel and guide us in  developing right systems for town planning, water management, traffic  management, etc.</p>
<p>Sri Shrivatsa introduced Jagannath Poddar of  Friends of Vrindavan, which collects 1/3rd of the waste from the  Vrindavan municipal area and also voluntarily disposes of biomedical  waste from 103 hospitals and medical clinics in the Mathura-Vrindavan  area.</p>
<p>Jagannath Poddar replied to Shrivatsaji’s question if  Vrindavan had an eco city status saying that there was such a plan, put  forward by the Central Pollution Board in cooperation with GTZ, a German  group, but it fell through. The only holy place that was able to get  this status is Tirupati. The plan required a 50-50 partnership between  the municipality and the CPB, and this could not happen in Vrindavan.</p>
<p>Sri  Shrivatsa also inquired about Tourism Master Plan of Braj Region  prepared by IL&amp;FS and The Braj Foundation under MVDA being  sanctioned and implemented as per the newspaper reports. Sri Padmanabh  Goswami replied that it is yet to be sanctioned. Sri Shrivatsa said that  this is just as well, as this permits further input to be taken from  the various groups serving the cause of proper conservation and  development in Braj. Hence the urgency of preparing comprehensive plans  as per the world heritage site guidelines of UNESCO.</p>
<p>Sri  Parasuramenen thanked all for the information he received at the  meeting. He said on behalf of UNESCO that he was definitely interested  in serving Braj. He reported that two letters have already been sent:  One from his predecessor to the Chairman the UP State Advisory Board in  May 2009 expressing concern and offering UNESCO’s technical support, the  other written by him in December 2009.</p>
<p>UNESCO has the technical  expertise to look at a plan and to ensure participation of the  community. He offered to sensitize various contacts in the government  and media about the issue.</p>
<p>Sri Parasuramenen said as the  custodian of promotion and preservation efforts as Director of UNESCO,  his presence is clear indication of their support.</p>
<p>After getting  invitation from the citizens and the local bodies like Nagarapalika  Parishad, he offered to bring experts from various field of heritage  planning to Vrindavan for workshop and a formal meeting. In the  meantime, experts from UNESCO could visit Vrindavan and Vrindavan  citizens would be welcome to his office in Delhi for consultations.</p>
<p>He  also said he would come officially with specialists from all the five  areas of work where UNESCO is active and this multi-speciality team of  experts would discuss the whole issue with stakeholders here.</p>
<p>To  Sri Shrivatsa&#8217;s suggestion that the next formal meeting with UNESCO be  held at Vrindavan Research Institute, Shri Malaviya agreed and Sri  Parasuramen said UNESCO would co- sponsor the event and for which he  will arrange Hindi-English interpreters, and hoped that the formal  meeting would lead to some concrete follow-up action.<br />
He appreciated  that there is a common concern. A larger consensus, he said, can be  built at different levels, local, state and central.</p>
<p>He said he  would propose concrete support for harmonious development. UNESCO works  in holistic tourism and wants that the heart of Vrindavan, the local  people, be benefited. He assured everyone of his personal engagement in  this.</p>
<p>It was resolved that Nagar Palika Parishad of Vrindavan be  the empowered developmental authority, together with MVDA and citizens,  and that they should all be invited to the formal meeting at VRI  sometime in mid-February 2010.</p>
<p>All the members present resolved to come together as partners in the service of Vrindavan and Braj Mandala.</p>
<p>Sri  Padmanabh Goswami thanked Sri Parasuramen on behalf of the citizens and  NGOs of Vrindavan for his willingness to serve the cause of Vrindavan  and Braj.</p>

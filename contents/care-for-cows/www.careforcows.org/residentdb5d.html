</h2><p id="fullinfobar">Is a Bull, born on 2006-02-26, who joined us on 2007-01-18.</p><img src="images/residents/cowfulls/balaram.jpg" class="residentfullimg" align="left"><p class="testimonial">By now you know the story. My mother stopped giving milk, so I was put out on the streets of Govardhana.  After some wandering, I happened upon rows of fruit carts. The tantalizing smell was irresistible and this is where I decided to stay. Life was rough though. I quickly learned that putting my nose too close to those carts meant a swift, sharp blow from a stick. Ouch! And waiting for the rotting fruit to be thrown to the ground meant trying to sneak behind and between the legs of other much bigger cows hoping to catch a bite before they spotted me and bucked me away. One day, a family noticed me and decided to take me home. I was a sorry sight. My ribs and spine jutted out from beneath my skin. I was filthy and covered with scars and lacerations. Though it was July, I still hadn't shed my winter fur.  But I really didn't want to leave those fruit carts. The family tried to convince me to stay, but I ran away from their home at every opportunity. They even fed me bananas each day. But I'm the type that has a hard time adjusting to new circumstances even if the old ones were awful.Eventually I settled into my new life. After being fed three hearty meals day after day, I fattened up and even grew a brand new coat of silky white fur. Soon, Krsna joined me. He and I are best buddies. If I get separated from him, I get very upset.The family feeding us lived near fields that filled up with green grass as the monsoon rains fell. So Krsna and I contented ourselves with munching grass throughout the day between meals. But when the grass dried up, we started wandering the streets like before. The family tried to stop us, but I was intent on finding those fruit carts again and I thought Krsna would probably like them too. So every morning we'd go to the family's house for a filling breakfast, then we'd head out to the fruit market gambling on the slight chance that we just might get a tidbit of tasty fruit.One day we got too close to someone's cart and he beat us. My nose was swollen from a bloody gash and Krsna's eye was swollen shut. The people who fed us were very upset. They realized that it was only a question of time before we were injured further, or worse, taken off for slaughter. That's when they decided that we should go to Care for Cows. It's an amazing feeling to have a full belly almost all the time and I'm slowly adjusting to life here. It helps that my best friend is here too. When you sponsor me, would you send a tidbit extra so I can get some fruit from time to time?</p><hr id="clear"><link rel="stylesheet" href="images/js/lightbox/lightbox.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />

  <p>My situation is a solemn one. Life is offered to me on condition of eating beefsteaks. But death is better than cannibalism. My will contains directions for my funeral, which will be followed not by mourning coaches, but by oxen, sheep, flocks of poultry, and a small traveling aquarium of live fish, all wearing white scarfs in honor of the man who perished rather than eat his fellow creatures.</p>

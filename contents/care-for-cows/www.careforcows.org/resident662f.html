</h2><p id="fullinfobar">Is a Cow, born on 1998-06-01, who joined us on 2002-04-25.</p><img src="images/residents/cowfulls/yasoda.jpg" class="residentfullimg" align="left"><p class="testimonial">As far as I know I have always lived in the streets so I take it I was born there. I was only a few months old when I was separated from my mother and began wandering aimlessly. Like that two long years passed. One summer the heat dried whatever little greenery remained and being weak, I could not compete with the stronger cows to get a share of the garbage. I had been beaten with a stick by so many vegetable venders that I had lost confidence in the human race. In this frame of mind I sat in the scant shade of a tree and prepared to fast until death. But a pious lady noticed me and began to bring me food and water daily. I remember her shaking her head and saying,"My, my... you are just skin and bones."She called Care for Cows and asked them to take me in... that I would surely die if they didn't. They agreed but as I had never experienced being cared for, I was not the least bit interested in going. Two cowherd men appeared planning to walk me to the goshalla but I flatly refused to go. Despite my resistance they loaded me on a bullock cart and carried me off.  Just see how I looked upon arrival. I was so skinny I couldn't poop. It's not easy to break into a new herd, especially if you're sickly. The first days were really hard as the other cows bullied me and called me Boney Butt... and later B.B. for short. It was humiliating. But the cowherd men gave me special food and as I regained my health and morale, gradually the cows accepted me and I felt at home.I have a great appetite and I think that is what turned the tide for me. Gradually I became strong and no one could push me around anymore. My self esteem was fully restored when several of the handsome resident bulls competed to win my hand. I was no longer called B.B. and you can see why.Almost everyday visitors offer us sweets, vegetable cuttings, or fruit. Some of them become inspired and sponsor all of our food for a day. Others offer to sponsor the maintenance of one of us for a month or longer. Though I had been at Care for Cows for more than a year, no one had yet chosen to sponsor me. But one day an especially exuberant man named Nitin visited and offered us bananas. He told the cowherd man that he wanted to sponsor a cow for his sister who was pregnant and wanted to know which cows needed sponsors. One of the cowherd men walked up to me and as he scratched my belly telling the visitor that I was also pregnant, my eyes met Nitin's and we really connected. It was love at first sight. Just see what a happy couple we are... and he's not even my sponsor! I can't imagine how wonderful his sister must be.  Nitin stayed a few days and returned to U.K. with many pictures for his sister. He left wondering who would be the first to deliver, his sister or me. I'm happy to announce that my calf was born on November 15, 2003. Shortly after giving birth, a solemn thought struck me:"What will be the fate of my calf? I pray that she will not have to wander the streets like I had to." Just then a young woman appeared in the barnyard wearing a sari and, gracefully smiling like a gopi, asked the cowherd men,"For many years I have wanted to sponsor a cow in Vrindavan. Are there any available?"They gave her a quick tour and many of the cows who used to call me B.B. came up to her trying to show their best side. But being shy, she was not inclined to their persistence. Then she saw my calf who was not more than 10 hours old. My heart started thumping... and when she said,"I'll sponsor this one.", I experienced the happiest moment of my life. My prayer had been answered. Later that mysterious young lady named my calf Jai Radhe and I took it as a hint of who must be her Mistress.</p><hr id="clear"><link rel="stylesheet" href="images/js/lightbox/lightbox.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />

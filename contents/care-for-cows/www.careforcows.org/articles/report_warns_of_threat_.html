    <h1>Report Warns of Threat to Milk Supply</h1>

    <div class="entry"> 
   
  <p>About a third of an ounce of botulism toxin poured by bioterrorists into<br />
a milk truck en route from a dairy farm to a processing plant could<br />
cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in<br />
economic losses, according to a scientific analysis that was published<br />
yesterday despite efforts by federal officials to keep the details secret.</p>
<p>The analysis by researchers at Stanford University, posted yesterday on<br />
the Web site of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,<br />
seeks to quantify security weaknesses in the nation's milk-supply chain<br />
and makes recommendations for closing those gaps.</p>
<p>Although some suggested changes are underway, federal officials felt the<br />
material had enough potential for misuse to warrant a last-minute effort<br />
to halt publication. That effort, which delayed the report's release by<br />
a month but ultimately did not keep it from becoming public, proved to<br />
be as contentious as the publication itself. It has assured the report's<br />
place in the scientific canon as one of the first test cases of how to<br />
balance scientific freedom and national security in the post-Sept. 11 era.</p>
<p>Study leader Lawrence M. Wein, whose previous research had forecast the<br />
likely effects of terrorist attacks involving anthrax and smallpox, said<br />
he was surprised by the government's push to block publication, which<br />
involved a flurry of phone calls and meetings with officers of the<br />
National Academies. The organization advises the federal government on<br />
matters of science and publishes the journal.</p>
<p>Last fall, Wein said, he briefed high-ranking officials of the<br />
departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, along<br />
with dairy industry representatives, on his work.</p>
<p>"It was clear the dairy people were nervous about this paper coming<br />
out," Wein said. But when federal officials did not follow up, he said,<br />
he assumed they had concluded -- as had every reviewer at the National<br />
Academies -- that the information in the article was publicly available<br />
and easily obtained through a Google search.</p>
<p>Bill Hall, a spokesman for HHS, said yesterday that his department still<br />
opposes publication but was not in a position to block release of the<br />
data, which are not classified.</p>
<p>"We don't see eye to eye on this," Hall said. "If this ends up being the<br />
wrong decision down the road, the consequences could be quite severe and<br />
HHS will have to deal with it, not the National Academies."</p>
<p>The analysis by Wein and graduate student Yifan Liu considered what<br />
might happen if terrorists poured into a milk tanker truck a couple of<br />
gallons of concentrated sludge containing as much as 10 grams of<br />
botulinum toxin, a potent bacterial nerve poison now popular in low<br />
doses as a wrinkle eraser.</p>
<p>Because milk from many sources is combined in huge tanks holding<br />
hundreds of thousands of gallons, the toxin would get widely distributed<br />
in low, but potentially lethal, concentrations and within days be<br />
consumed by about 568,000 people, the report concludes.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledge that their numbers are very rough. But<br />
depending on how thoroughly the milk was pasteurized (which partially<br />
inactivates toxins) and how promptly the outbreak was detected and<br />
supplies recalled, about 400,000 people would be likely to fall ill,<br />
they conclude.</p>
<p>Symptoms of botulism food poisoning arise within hours and progress from<br />
cramps, nausea and vision problems to paralysis and death by<br />
asphyxiation. Although only 6 percent of victims would generally be<br />
expected to die, the death rate could easily hit 60 percent, they<br />
conclude, because there would not be nearly enough mechanical<br />
ventilators or doses of antitoxin to treat so many victims.</p>
<p>Children could be hit first and hardest, because milk goes directly from<br />
processing plants to schools, avoiding the grocery-distribution system.</p>
<p>"They'd be the canaries," Wein said.</p>
<p>The report concludes that the most efficient ways to reduce such risks<br />
are to insist that latches on tanker trucks have locks; improve<br />
pasteurization processes; and develop tests that can detect<br />
contamination before milk is delivered to outlets -- changes, the team<br />
concludes, that are likely to cost just a few pennies per gallon.</p>
<p>Publication was scheduled for the week of May 30, but was abruptly<br />
postponed days before that date when HHS officials contacted the<br />
National Academies with concerns that the paper might inadvertently aid<br />
terrorists, according to an accompanying editorial written by Bruce<br />
Alberts, president of the Academies.</p>
<p>Those concerns were discussed in detail on June 7, after which the<br />
Academies decided to publish. By then, a preprint of the article had<br />
been widely distributed to journalists as part of the journal's standard<br />
procedures, and the New York Times had published a summary by Wein in an<br />
opinion piece.</p>
<p>Barry R. Bloom, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, who oversaw<br />
an independent review of the paper earlier this spring, said he is<br />
convinced that the report did more good than harm by quantifying the<br />
risks posed at each point in the milk-delivery system -- a difficult job<br />
that now allows the industry and regulators to concentrate security<br />
efforts where they are most needed.</p>
<p>"This paper didn't just slip in with no one thinking about it," Bloom<br />
said. "But science depends on openness and the free exchange of ideas.<br />
And being aware of threats gives us a better chance of protecting<br />
against them than not being aware of them and having only the terrorists<br />
aware of them."</p>
<p>A national security directive signed by President Ronald Reagan and<br />
still in force demands that fundamental scientific information remain<br />
openly accessible unless it is formally classified.</p>
<p>Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation in<br />
Arlington, criticized the Academies' decision, saying the information<br />
"could inform someone with malicious designs on food safety, even just<br />
as a prank."</p>
<p>The need for improved pasteurization "is something that has already been<br />
addressed" by the industry, he said, as has the need to keep locks on<br />
truck latches.</p>
<p>He acknowledged, however, that those improvements, encouraged by the<br />
Food and Drug Administration in recent years, are not mandatory. And<br />
although he said the newer standards are being "widely followed," he<br />
conceded he had no data to indicate what proportion of dairies and milk<br />
processors are adhering to the tougher recommendations.</p>

  <p>Would you kill your pet dog or cat to eat it? How about an animal you're not emotionally attached to? Is the thought of slaughtering a cow or chicken or pig with your own hands too much to handle? Instead, would hiring a hit-man to do the job give you enough distance from the emotional discomfort? What animal did you put a contract out on for your supper last night? Did you at least make sure that none went to waste and to take a moment to be grateful for its sacrifice?</p>
